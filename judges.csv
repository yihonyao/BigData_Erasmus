"In an age when cinema has become entirely its own storytelling beast, its own approach to manifesting drama, the more accustomed acting for the camera being less and less drawn from the theatre, one greatly admires the work of actors like Chris Pine, the malleable concrete which forms the basis of Captain Kirk's reconstruction, and Zachary Quinto, who has a look of infinite dexterity in his obvious physical proclivity for Spock, who don't have to bounce around and reel off monologues ridden with words accentuated on paper with all caps, instead utilizing the great amount of character in their faces.",acting,,,,,
"Characters are either strippers or whores, whilst others are tied submissively and suggestively to beds and tortured.",acting,,,,,
"He actually fits into that part quite well, without delivering an overbearing performance like Dr. Stu's fiance, who director Todd Phillips makes sure we hate from the first minute she's on.Good",acting,,,,,

She added no personality!,acting,,,,,

Both Denzel and Gary have been around the movie block a few too many times by now.,acting,,,,,
"It's a very different movie from Russell's ""Huckabees,"" a film I adored, but yet his fingerprints are all over it, and its cast gels in the same exhilarating way that the cast of ""Huckabees"" did, sending you out on a high on the strength of the sheer talent on display.Certainly one of the best movies I've seen this year.Grade:",acting,,,,,

"Why Renner was nominated for Best Actor, I'll never know.",acting,,,,,
Bravo Daniel.,acting,,,,,
Channing Tatum is one of the worst actors along with Vin Diesel and Jason Statham.,acting,,,,,
They echoed the equal genius of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in the previous films and they didn't try to imitate them but instead made their own interpretations of Professor X and Magneto.,acting,,,,,
They did a marvelous job in their portrayals.,acting,,,,,
Both have fantastic chemistry and has created something that people can empathise and connect with.,acting,,,,,
His portrayal of Tom is certainly within reason.,acting,,,,,
"But Colin Firth brings nothing to the role of Haydon to match Ian Richardson's self-tormenting irony; it would have been interesting to see what Ciar_n Hinds, already in the cast but underemployed as Roy Bland, might have done with the role.",acting,,,,,
"I can't help but wish his character well, and that he returns safely home.Sadly it is the cavalcade of other characters that appear and whose roles are undeveloped that weaken the intensity of the film.",acting,,,,,
A+,acting,,,,,

There are a lot of fans of TOS that aren't going to like this movie.,acting,,,,,

"First, I give credit to them keeping it real at first.",acting,,,,,
Every performer shines in this film from the smallest part to supporting cast.,acting,,,,,
"As with all of these films the effects are first rate, I particularly like the way the character of Steve was made to look really weak and scrawny in the early scenes.",acting,,,,,
"Much to the concern of ""Jem"" who also sports an easily identifiable tattoo noted during the robbery.There is much to like here, the action scenes are believable and well staged in a urban style that ""Heat"" pioneered.",acting,,,,,
"James Franco taps on the glass observation window of the room carrying a clipboard, just doing his morning rounds.",acting,,,,,
The manner he speaks and move is what Keanu would be good at.Patrick Wilson is another perfect fit as Dan Dreiberg AKA Nite Owl II.,acting,,,,,
The only thing I knew was that this was a Woody Allen movie and everybody liked it.,acting,,,,,
"The ONLY saving grace was Jay Chou, who played Kato and The Black Beauty.",acting,,,,,
Robert Downey is solid as Tony Stark but even he can't save this from being a bit of a disappointment compared to the first one.,acting,,,,,

They were both terrific.,acting,,,,,
"While Neeson and Fiennes do their best to overcome the contrivances of the script, you can tell almost immediately that they really have no place in a film like this.",acting,,,,,
"None of them are believable, charismatic or even nice enough to care for them.",acting,,,,,
"He's returned as Flynn and just like how he was 27 years ago, Bridges plays it cool and chill, the only difference is that his character is much older now and the story has him worrying at times for his son, for the mistakes of the past, he's constantly haunted by it.. but don't worry.. Bridges 'The Dude' attitude is still intact, Flynn would once in a while say something along the line of 'you're messing with my jazz man!' I love Olivia Wilde in this film, not because she's a great actress but because as Flynn's apprentice Quorra, Wilde is just such a doll, her childlike personality is hard to resist.",acting,,,,,
The entire supporting cast is spot on and it shows to be one of the best ensembles of the decade.,acting,,,,,
Spiderman was a lot more entertaining to watch and with each emotion or timely one- liners played brilliantly by one Andrew Garfield.,acting,,,,,
It felt very natural - nobody ever said anything very witty.,acting,,,,,

From his first scene he sets the tone for his character.,acting,,,,,
"He has portrayed the character of Colter Stevens, an American Army helicopter pilot, quite well if in not the best way possible.",acting,,,,,
"I had no high hopes due to this being an angelina jolie poseur movie, maybe expected just a bit more due to IMDb's 6.5 rating but was tricked (again). the upside is that this is definitely the last one of these kinds I take a chance on.the",acting,,,,,
For once let's see how for real a Scottish and a Russian can interact with an American crew and spit blood as brothers in arms and not play just their stupid national cameos.,acting,,,,,
"He could have played it over the top, but here he seems very fitting as he portrays an ugly villain that is quite suitable.",acting,,,,,
Clever writing and cast.,acting,,,,,
He brings remarkable complexity to his part-cowboy part-genius bomb-defuser.,acting,,,,,
Matthew Goode tries his best but ultimately his performance as Ozymandias lacks the punch it should have had.,acting,,,,,

The relationship between Joel Courtney (Watch out Bieber!) and Riley Griffiths was very authentic.,acting,,,,,
Ryan Reynolds is well cast as Hal Jordan.,acting,,,,,
"A large supporting cast is headed by Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence, who plays blue shapeshifter Mystique.",acting,,,,,
"Something's wrong if as a movie director, your most believable character sucks, is one-dimensional, is not endearing or believable for a nano- second, and spends half the film trapped inside a shoe-box.",acting,,,,,

Hailee Steinfirld stole the movie and she truly was 14 when the movie was filmed!,acting,,,,,

 step of the way, every scene, every emotion, these two men own the 
 movie and watching their bromance is a treat from start to finish.",acting,,,,,
"Mark Wahlberg and Melissa Leo are outstanding, but the this movie is a showcase for Christiam Bale whose performance is remarkable bordering on incredible.",acting,,,,,
"There is no sense of class from Downey Jr in this role - it's as though he's remaking a Victorian version of ""Iron Man"" and it's an awful portrayal of Holmes.",acting,,,,,
The chemistry between the two leads will stick to your heart like a whole web-ball of warmth and charisma.,acting,,,,,
"This grumpy old man had to face everything went through his eyes, all over again.",acting,,,,,
Wasn't she someone not into the love scene?,acting,,,,,
"This movie to me stomps the best story lines out there, Crush's action films like ""The Matrix"".",acting,,,,,
"Hill is quiet, timid, and very smart.",acting,,,,,
"Billy was a great high school talent, 6-4 the perfect picture of a baseball player.",acting,,,,,
Sacha Baron Cohen has been over the top in this movie.,acting,,,,,
"Worthington is a suitable lead, but I see him heading to Stallone-esquire B-movies quickly if he doesn't find more interesting characters.",acting,,,,,
It even contains a cameo from Chaleston Heston!,acting,,,,,
I think the cast did the best that they could with the corny lines and terrible writing.Ryan,acting,,,,,
"But he is not one of those bookworm geniuses caught reading in the library or wearing a lab coat, rather he is a man of intellect who relies on his intuition with all disregard for the law, or any obstacle, for that matter.",acting,,,,,

"We really needed a Chris Nolan, JJ Abrams, or Peter Jackson on this one.",acting,,,,,
"Only Chekov and Sulu didn't really impress me (I never liked Sulu anyway), but they only played a minor part in the movie.The",acting,,,,,
"He plays a pretty heartless character, although we don't know a lot about his background, you can see the pain and torment and i think he does really well putting this across, he plays it well.",acting,,,,,
"John Cho's Sulu is the only true weak link of the updated cast, but that is mainly due to his character being given little to do other than get in a sword fight and screw up a warp jump.",acting,,,,,
"Truth is, I've seen better versions of those.Most of the actors here are competent in their roles.",acting,,,,,
A handful of ninja sword fights between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow are all very impressive.,acting,,,,,
Matt Damon is equal to Glen Campbell's performance in the original but everyone else falls short to a greater or lesser degree.,acting,,,,,
And where else could you see Eli Roth (director of gory current US cult horror flicks) pretending to be Antonio Margheriti (director of gory sixties Italian cult horror flicks).,acting,,,,,
"Chris Hemsworth at least looked like he tried to get into the role, but none can blame him for failing with her as a partner.",acting,,,,,
"Thank Heavens!With enough screen time on hand, Yates was able to bring back Hermione and Ron into center stage, as what Rowling intended to in the first place.",acting,,,,,

He's not always dead serious and acts just like you would expect a god to act.,acting,,,,,
"Liam Neeson was excellent here, you really into his characters head, but although it is clear he's the star, but he never hogs the attention for himself, he lets all the characters shine also.",acting,,,,,
"With an eye for action sequences and a feel for lapses in dialogue, Mr. Bird's first live action outing is quite impressive.",acting,,,,,
"That was a shame, because Sparrow was amazing in the previous movies, especially the way he moved and twitched about constantly.Mermaids?",acting,,,,,
"All of the conflicts in the film were summed up so quickly, the build up seemed pointless entirely.",acting,,,,,
Perhaps its the fact that Tom Hiddleston was on for hardly an eighteenth of the film.,acting,,,,,
She was the best villain I have seen in I don't know how long.,acting,,,,,
I just hope they invest a little more cash to get more A-list quality actors.,acting,,,,,
"He had the looks, the voice, and the charisma I was expecting.",acting,,,,,
"The presence of Rachel McAdams as Irene also brought a different dimension to the first movie because she was a great partner and, as Sherlock mentions in the story, she is ""the woman"" and I could not hide my disappointment when I noticed that her presence in The Game Of Shadows would not only be important, but also brief... very brief.Instead of Rachel McAdams, now there is Noomi Rapace performing gypsy Simza Heron, a character that appears and disappears and no one even notice that during the movie.",acting,,,,,
"She did a fantastic job as Lisbeth Salander, her Oscar nod and stardom is totally worth it.",acting,,,,,
Reynolds seems to be just as confused as he plays the character sometimes with a complete straight face and sometimes with a smirk irony as if he knew that the whole thing is just preposterous.,acting,,,,,
"The movie spent much time developing the main character, Sgt.",acting,,,,,
"Whether or not Weta can work their magic on a human character remains to be seen, but the potential is definitely there, and it's exciting.",acting,,,,,
"This movie deserves just a 4 out of 10 from me, but I give it a 5, for Woody Harrelson and a brief apparition from Arnold (""I believe ze worst ist now overr!"" ).",acting,,,,,
Gary Goldman's acting is rather similar to a manikin; his expressionless stares are an example of how poor so many actors are nowadays.,acting,,,,,
"Downey as Sherlock Holmes, another drug addicted, crazed, brilliant and erratic creature, is a perfect fit.",acting,,,,,
It's very hard to deliver such a performance with just a couple of lines.,acting,,,,,
"Scott implemented the same typical design as he did in the alien series.Overall, the acting was alright, not great, alright.",acting,,,,,
He delivers a genuine performance as opposed to just seeming to be a collection of cute tricks.,acting,,,,,
The camera work and direction appear to be ..... Actually I'm going to stop there.Im giving this 2 stars - I'd like to give it more because Waltz really was inspiring as the SS officer - I'd even go as far as to say he's almost deserving of an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor if you assume Pitt is the lead.This is a bad film.,acting,,,,,
This in turn made him look weaker and weaker.,acting,,,,,
"He came across as nerdy like the Peter Parker everyone loves, but less dweeby than Tobey was in his movies (sorry Tobey, still love ya bro).",acting,,,,,
Ditto for the flawless Katie and Micah.Put this movie at the top of your Halloween list.,acting,,,,,
"Please....Tho' there are some fairly well developed characters with acute acting, the script is full of flaws...whats the possibility of a french dairy granger verbalising English in 41?",acting,,,,,
"You have your typical hapless young hero/narrator who was a desperate virgin indulging in his own delusion of grandeur...who through a series of events evolves into someone with a backbone worth of being called ""kick-ass"" the name of his alter-ego.",acting,,,,,
"Although he is one of the more sensitive humans around, he still suffers from arrogance and selfishness.",acting,,,,,
She adds humor and a sense of the absurdity of Capitol life.,acting,,,,,
"Milk, Howl (dreadful film, great performance) and Pineapple Express are all splendid and he was very much the right person for the job here.",acting,,,,,
"Also, Scott Glenn was awesome in his David Carradine-like role of the Wise Man.",acting,,,,,
The outstanding cast work so well together.,acting,,,,,
"In fact he still remains in my ""why is he famous"" category.",acting,,,,,
Thor only seemed 'interested' just before the kiss...was all the polite talk just Asgardian flirting?,acting,,,,,
I felt that this year was lacking a good comedy and this movie really delivered.,acting,,,,,
"Yet, we get a few extremely enjoyable moments - some funny, some sweet - every now and then.As for the acting, well, we're only sorry to see so little of Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, and company.",acting,,,,,
"Instead of a great film, they were looking to get the most bucks from fans of Kristen Stewart (Razzie for Worst Actress) and Chris Hemsworth (darling of People's Choice, MTV, and Teen Choice awards).Oscar",acting,,,,,

"Angelina Jolie is an actress who have done very different kind of roles under the years but i most say that my favorite roll with her must be in Bone Collector (1999) there she did a very good preferment (the same director did this film Philip Noyce) But under this years she have done different kind of performance, some good, others more closer outstanding like her performance in Changling and she have also do some crappy performance like in Wanted, but in Salt she did good.Evelyn",acting,,,,,

You surprisingly don't wish he were a young Woody instead as he injects lots of wide-eyed ingenuousness along with just the right dash of the director's classic nebbish.Wilson,acting,,,,,
"With only three apparent possible editing or directorial alternatives (the selection of the female lead and the biting of the mouth timing, the shot selection for the perceptual view of the rehearsing (unlike Chorus Line), and the murder scene that didn't seem to quite have the clarity of character persona transformation and credibility), this amazing personal almost mature David Lynch-like presentation makes Blawk Swan a voyage of discovery and layered emotional and psychological density the most absorbing, powerful movie of the year.",acting,,,,,
My only complaint about this sequel is that Mycroft Holmes' character was dismissed as utter garbage.Hans,acting,,,,,
The directing had a lot to do with it as well because Kenneth Branagh is a serious and dedicated director; he has proved it time after time with his adaptations of Shakespearean plays.,acting,,,,,
Both played their part adequately.,acting,,,,,
"Considering the first description of his typical character, I'd say his performance here was absolutely grand.",acting,,,,,
"Roles like his in ""Boogie Nights"" and ""I Heart Huckabees"" make a case for an actor that should lay off the heavy drama every so often and recoil with something silly.",acting,,,,,
I am not a fan of Michael Cera.,acting,,,,,
"Fortunately, Christian Bale is a match for his forceful personality in a role plays a little bit like ""Elliot Ness: The Early Years"" but that also has a bit more depth even without seeing any of his character's life outside of his working environment.Although the film is, essentially, a two-hander it's a major bonus for film fans that almost every role (no matter the size) is cast with someone suitable and of suitable quality.",acting,,,,,

"While Firth almost remains poised for a much needed Oscar glory(Jeff Bridges' turn in True Grit might eclipse him), the movie is almost certain to snag Best picture, direction, original screenplay and probably a best supporting actor nomination at the Oscars.Do give it a watch.",acting,,,,,
"It is also almost entirely devoid of cheap shocks, which is very much to its credit.The movie delivers an amazing performance from both leading characters, but especially from Ben Foster whose Corporal Bower is both strong and vulnerable, barely keeping it together.",acting,,,,,
Her sexuality is ambiguous.,acting,,,,,

"Looking at the critical praise in 2005 of Robert Rodriguez ultra-violent comic Film-Noir Sin City,seemed to suggest a good possibility that violent Film-Noir would be making an impact in Hollywood.Sadly,with Rodriguez unsure over the follow-up,and Sin City's own creator,Frank ""Robocop 3"" Miller showing everyone why he should be kept 100 yards away from a movie camera with his 2008 Noir-stylised adaption bomb of Will Einer's The Spirit,any sign of a mainstream Noir movement in Hollywood seemed to die almost as soon as it had started.Luckally,something very exciting was bubbling away in a part of Europe called Scandinavia.Perhaps, not since the Italian Giallo genre had caved in has a Noir influence movement become so connected with one location in Europe,with the Nordic Noir movement delivering such smash hits as Henning Mankell's Wallander novels/adaptation's and the transatlantic surprise hit TV series The Killing.And whist these and many others have made a huge impact on Noirdic Noir,there has always been one trilogy of novels at the very top of the Nordic list:the Millennium Trilogy by investigating journalist Stieg Larsson (1954-2004),and with having been a huge fan Niels Arden Oplev's wonderful 2009 take on the first part of the trilogy,I became extremely excited,when earlier this year it was announced that David Fincher was going to deliver a 90 million dollar take on this Noir epic.",none,,,,,

"The hero Garfield is shown as quite lean and slim and lacks maturity as he remains a college boy, Heroism is more of Humanly than super.",storyline,,,,,
"Best of all, because of the way it has been cleverly written and directed, you need not have seen a single frame of any of the many entries in the franchise to appreciate what Team Abrams hath wrought.",storyline,,,,,
"It's a movie about a war, not about time-traveling back in time, stopping John Connor from leading the humans to victory.People who hated this movie expected too much from it.",storyline,,,,,

District 9 fetched the character of Gregorio Samsa the main protagonist from La metamorfosis and one can easily relate the character in this movie to the novel.,storyline,,,,,
It does not come anywhere near the unprecedented standards set by the dark knight or for that matter does not even come close to spiderman 2. The movie is often commended for its humor.,storyline,,,,,
"She can't get ahold of her loving husband Mike--a German national who got her out of a rut in North Korea two years earlier--and makes a break for it and goes on the run like ""The Fugitive"" meets a female version of ""XXX.""The action happens like a linear video game as it feels rehearsed and formulaic, than being unpredictable and truly challenging.",storyline,,,,,
":-)However, overall it suffers from being almost too slick.",storyline,,,,,
I sure did and this movie kept surprising me the entire 2 hours.,storyline,,,,,
"The movie offers an intriguing idea and tries to make a go of it, but it bogs down and it doesn't take much effort to connect the dots.",storyline,,,,,
"However, apart from its minor defects that many will tend to overlook, X-Men First Class is huge step forward from its dragging, mediocre & star-studded predecessor trilogy.Therefore,",storyline,,,,,

one thing i can say is that You might need to see at least twice to understand it.Thanks for such wonderful film,storyline,,,,,
"worst, it devolves Star Trek into a shinier ripoff of Star Wars, in a transparent attempt to appeal to the masses.Once its predecessor ST-X:Nemesis(2002) broke the even-numbered-charm by losing money, Star Trek(2009)'s seven producers should've known better than to again invoke Romulan terrorism for a plot.",storyline,,,,,

"Ship crashes into the heart of LA, after suffering a direct nuclear blast.",storyline,,,,,
But that's probably because I have watched it Alien and even though I tried had I couldn't help but compare the story to the original which was a masterpiece.,storyline,,,,,

So the scene is set 2 years after the bachelor party in LA went array.,storyline,,,,,
These were screwball comedies set against a very real backdrop of Nazi brutality.,storyline,,,,,

"be honest, this film knocked me for 6 as after watching the trailer I was expecting to see a transporter 'esque action film but in reality the film is so much more.At the start, scenes with hardly any dialogue are inter-spliced with silent, richly detailed scenes which in some ways tell us more about the characters than a 1000 spoken words ever could.",storyline,,,,,
"After the film, you know nearly as little about the lead characters as you did going in.It's one of the most straight forward movies I've seen in years.",storyline,,,,,
The Flash Gordon parts are stellar though.,storyline,,,,,

My God was that a great adaptation.,storyline,,,,,
"No, now he is a coward, who watches Dumbledore die even though he could have done something.",storyline,,,,,
"For example, the opening scene.",storyline,,,,,

Do you feel connected with the characters?,storyline,,,,,
Christine has to struggle with her choice and whether self-gain is more important than the well being of others.,storyline,,,,,
"Actors and critics alike fall over backwards to praise his work yet i find it all very bland.Midnight in Paris is an odd film about a writer who , while on vacation in Paris with his wife to be, finds a way to go back in time to meet famous artists , writers and musicians and he soon realises that this world is far better than the one he currently lives in.As is any Woody Allen movie , Midnight in Paris is very dialogue orientated , and i have no problem with that but what i don't like is the pretentiousness of it.",storyline,,,,,

"If she's feels it necessary for the characters to show an interest in the opposite sex because of their age, it should have been scaled back considerably in my opinion.Overall a good experience and a very good movie.",storyline,,,,,
"Whatever ""that"" was is what the story becomes about.",storyline,,,,,
"lo and behold, Ethan and Joel Coen did it again, with their sheer quality shining through the adaptation of Charles Portis novel without batting an eyelid, and never far away from the idiosyncrasies that make a film an identifiable Coen product.",storyline,,,,,
In Panem all children aged 12-18 from all districts are entered in a lottery to be chosen to participate in what is known as the hunger games.,storyline,,,,,
"I know this, but bear with me, for I must declare this movie to be one of the best I've seen yet.",storyline,,,,,

This movie was actually worse than Blair Witch.,storyline,,,,,

What a joyride from beginning to end!,storyline,,,,,
"For example, when Bryan's (Leam) ""war""-buddies come for a barbecue and start spouting their past adventures.",storyline,,,,,

I try but fail to understand all the hype.,storyline,,,,,

"All in all this is what you want from a film, engaging, thought provoking, amazing attention to detail, multi-layered, a solid story and expert direction.",storyline,,,,,
"not for everyone, it does become really slow at times, but the script more than makes up for the pace.But",storyline,,,,,
highly recommend for fans of the series as i doubt Breaking Dawn will live up to these standards,storyline,,,,,
"I AM aware that not everybody likes sinking into the movie like I do, but even if you won't find the story as satisfying as I did you'll love this movie anyways.Bottom",storyline,,,,,
With some intelligence its easy to notice all the layers and subtleties Prometheus has to offer under the surface.,storyline,,,,,
But I was.I've seen all three endings to Paranormal Activity and I have to say that it really doesn't matter which one you see.,storyline,,,,,

"The popular 'Expectations/Reality' scene in which, on one side of the screen, Tom gains summer back (the expectations) and on the other side of the screen, where he is completely ignored by her (the reality).",storyline,,,,,
"Sure some of the effects are well made, but that doesn't make up for a lousy plot, with a endless row of lose ends and meaningless setups that doesn't get a follow-up.",storyline,,,,,
"While true brilliance may have alluded Mann due to the odd pacing issue and really offering nothing masterfully unique, this flick is one that fully immerses you in the time and shows us of a time of when celebrity did not always mean Hollywood, and endings were not always storybook.Read",storyline,,,,,
The movie delivers the kind of pleasures usually reserved for fan fiction or playground stand-offs.,storyline,,,,,
"For them profit is proof of quality.Yet there is not enough money in the world to unmake this low brow, dull and entirely clueless failure of a tribute.",storyline,,,,,
"Not a children's cartoon apparently unsuccessful, although a lot of funny moments.The",storyline,,,,,
no storyline is even near to it.,storyline,,,,,
"Unlike that film, Kick-Ass's central love story is between a father and daughter, the former educating the latter by shooting her in the chest with a handgun from ten yards.",storyline,,,,,
The one problem i had with the film was the changing of the ending.,storyline,,,,,
"The US political system, military posturing and blind patriotism are all given a bit of a roasting by David Hayter and Alex Tse's script.",storyline,,,,,
It is in many ways a great film.,storyline,,,,,

"For all the fans out there, that's exactlicly what they've been trying to sell us on this AWFUL movie (?). Great special effects in these days are no longer an excuse for an empty movie.",storyline,,,,,
"We burn down our own forests, we fight wars with each other, and we destroy each other's lives.",storyline,,,,,
In the other world her mother (Teri Hatcher) is boring and so is her father (John Hodgman).,storyline,,,,,
"Newsflash to the shallow armchair hacks on IMDb: This film was a giant metaphor and wasn't supposed to be a realistic story!! FFS people, the metaphors aren't even that subtle, which is a big reason why this film was able to secure a solid budget & cast one of the best actors in the world ... because it is a decent 'crossover' film between independent artistic films and the bluntly obvious clich Hollywood action movies.",storyline,,,,,
The annoying thing is I find the premise cool and would like to see it revisited properly.,storyline,,,,,
Because this movie is SLOWWWW and Im not sure what is so great about it.,storyline,,,,,
Characters have been developed to a whole new level in the film allowing one of the littlest characters Dobby the house elf to own the screen.,storyline,,,,,
"For me however, I thought it was really a great twist, not a better Sherlock Holmes, but a different one.The fight scenes (or ""pre-fight scenes) were my favorite parts of the movie, how he would break down in his head what exactly he would be doing, and then perform the actions without error.I",storyline,,,,,

"And Katie takes the camera and instead of turning it off and/or putting it down... we see Micah stupidly going into the ""attic"" as if he'd be able to do anything if there is anyone or anything there.Acting: 3, I can't relate to the characters.",storyline,,,,,
A good movie that had more action than scares .,storyline,,,,,
The emotional arc of the movie is lost in the second part that is found in the fist.,storyline,,,,,

Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to help save the Earth from Loki and his army.I want to first address the IMDb rating on this film.,storyline,,,,,

The only thing I found out from reading all of these reviews is that there are tons of people who either feel good about writing bad reviews or they simply cannot appreciate a good film with incredible depth and emotional movement.,storyline,,,,,
"There are some very emotional scenes, but they are too hasty as though left incomplete.",storyline,,,,,
But Albert is convinced him and Joey will be reunited again and will stop at nothing to make that happen.Do you ever see an actor or actress in a film for the first time and remember that actor or actress as that particular role for the rest of their career?,storyline,,,,,
And it's one of Shakespeare's most heavily critiqued plays - a lot of people have criticised it.,storyline,,,,,
"also really patronising with the ""save the planet"" theme being constantly jammed down our throats.",storyline,,,,,
It has that Shakespearean quality about it.,storyline,,,,,
"There are some interesting moments & some nice homages to previous horror movies both in the US & Japan , but overall I felt it could have been so much more & felt like a missed opportunity to do something different.",storyline,,,,,
"Let me give you some examples of the misleading threads in this story, the ones that are inconsistent or even contradictory of that world as it has been created and as we all expect it to be.If Dumbledore is the one who knows above all other what this love is, he would not be making inquiries of Harry about his relationship with Hermione (he would either already know, or he would be able to tell by watching them).",storyline,,,,,

Mr. Bay you can__t fool people all the time and the people who grew up with the transformers are absolutely hating this movie.,storyline,,,,,
"They are so much a part of the trailers yet a tiny part of the film.Most of my complaints I know are not entirely the fault of the movie, it is, from what I understand, a very faithful adaptation of the book.",storyline,,,,,
Some of that does happen but as it turns out the film is more about the final battle of this group of misfits after they have already made a name for themselves.,storyline,,,,,
"As the plot develops, the viewer seems to grow closer and closer to the characters.",storyline,,,,,
"Of course, it's a little ludicrous, but it's so amazingly different and so finely depicted it's almost perceivable.",storyline,,,,,
"me put it this way: if this movie was made write-by-committee to be the genre film it is, the initial premise would become gimmick once several obvious options for flat and uninspired twists appear in the narrative, in the hopes that it would dazzle enough people to make money before everyone noticed that it doesn't make any sense.",storyline,,,,,
"Schwarzenegger and Willis are great fun here, but they're like the two popular uncles of the family who turn up at a party, greet everybody and then rush off again; for a scene featuring three of the most iconic action stars of all time, it's underwhelming.",storyline,,,,,
"The bachelor brunch that Stu has in mind, however, takes place stateside at an I-HOP before he hops onto a jet.",storyline,,,,,
"The film is very straightforward in its storytelling, focusing its energy on crafting a tale about characters who feel powerfully and don't know how to tame those feelings.",storyline,,,,,
"The last release here, fell far far short of living up the the previous movies, and it does not even deserve to carry the name Terminator.",storyline,,,,,

I thought they needed to spend way more time on Ellen Page and Decaprio's relationship.,storyline,,,,,
Owen agrees with JT and seems so nervous on missions that he is about to have a mental breakdown at any moment.,storyline,,,,,
"And in the end, those cheers don't change anything or make you one of the ""good guys"".I found the audiences reactions to be more amusing than the movie itself.",storyline,,,,,
"This movie is so awful, so devoid of anything that even remotely resembles a work of art that one can reasonably conclude that the director was instructed to sacrifice any vestige of artistic quality in order to make a quick buck.",storyline,,,,,
The toys have made him this person.,storyline,,,,,
"The two elements never gel, and you have to wonder why we spend so long dwelling on Ron's romance with an infatuated student when his house has just been burned to the ground and his whole family put into peril.The film is full of plot holes (why didn't the bad guys blow up the Burrows at the beginning, with Harry and everyone else inside?) and suffers from real pacing problems.",storyline,,,,,
"In real world if some skinny scientist woman calls hard boiled marine dumb and worthless with nasty attitude, she would find herself pretty soon collecting her teeth on the floor even if the guy is in a wheelchair.",storyline,,,,,
"But I was expecting too at least see the return off some cool robot characters, and in that respect the film just teases!This feels like an abrupt end off a trilogy too.",storyline,,,,,
It didn't engage me.,storyline,,,,,
"With that being said, it is a movie after all and they clearly weren't going for a realistic approach to survival in conditions anyone would die from no matter how skilled they are.",storyline,,,,,
"Rigorous science was never the strong point of Star Trek, one accepts the conventions in order to enjoy the show, so the space travel as well as hint of alternate universes Abrams likes is used here as well, and it's not necessary to analyze it too closely to find some flaws.",storyline,,,,,
"The Earth is in peril, and its fate depends on a handful of superhumans.",storyline,,,,,
The problem is the questioning stagnates and closure never really gets through.,storyline,,,,,

"Eventually the director lost sight of the book, and had Japan nuke the games.",storyline,,,,,
(Picture Darth Vader bowing to the Emperor in Empire strikes back/Megatron bowing like a pathetic loser to the Fallen).,storyline,,,,,
"Don't say that I don't get it, because I understood everything about this movie.",storyline,,,,,
"If the movie just stuck to them, and didn't bother to add the bizarre love story last minute between Shoshana and the black projectionist, or a painfully long bar game with characters useless to the plot, or waste so much time on the star of ""A Nation's Pride""; it would have been far more enjoyable.Also, for no reason Samuel L Jackson narrated 10 seconds of the movie.",storyline,,,,,
"It had a mediocre plot and an okay script, but there is just something about a 12 year old cussing people out that kind of bothers me?",storyline,,,,,
"And with this superhuman figure appearance every realism disappears and with realism also humor.The movie evolves then from a lighthearted sarcastic comedy to a simple Hollywood brainless action flick, still funny for many (male) teens or adults (including myself !) because of the exaggerated action and situations.",storyline,,,,,
The Death Eaters infiltration of the castle should have been met by opposition from the Order of the Phoenix.,storyline,,,,,

"The slower pace, the constant nature visuals, the music, the lack of dialogue and traditional narrative, all these things would be surprising and off- putting.",storyline,,,,,
The film really is a social commentary or reflection on South African and racism from the old Apartheid days.,storyline,,,,,
"After the movie has ended, I was still wondering what the movie is all about.It started quite spectacularly and I must admit I was quite impress with the special effect.",storyline,,,,,
This big budgeted production by Joel Silver sparkles with polish and wit and the ending is as exciting as moving and being well directed by Guy Ritchie .,storyline,,,,,
"Fortunately, late in the film there are some glimmers of hope...some.",storyline,,,,,
"But it came as a shock to me when I noticed that I'd seen before; only it was called 'The Last Samurai,' 'On Deadly Ground,' 'Pocahontas,' and several other things.",storyline,,,,,
"I liked that little subplot with Jason Statham, especially when he kicked that guy's ass for smacking her around.",storyline,,,,,
But well somehow it also felt hollow.,storyline,,,,,
"Shaw wanted Magneto do display his power by moving a coin, and to provoke him he shoots his mother right in front of him and yes he triggers Magneto's powers in the process.So basically, Magneto's initial intentions are revenge against a single person rather than humanity.",storyline,,,,,

"Well,the guy is in a robot,and when the tiger,or what ever that thing is,destroys the weapon,the robot pulls out his OWN BATTLE KNIFE!",storyline,,,,,
for me as a horror movie lover i just had to watch it.,storyline,,,,,
I for one is open to almost all kinds of jokes but this just didn't seem all that funny.,storyline,,,,,

"The era of the superheroes (which started in 1940, as sort of costume club) is coming to an end.",storyline,,,,,
"As for audience appeal I can say only this: being a PG-13 movie with such dark and sexual overtones the dialog and presentation feels aimed at the intellect of a 6 year old audience.Further, the way that characters just hop in and out of scenes, unannounced, and unexplained ruined most every major action sequence for me.The three main characters can't ever figure anything out on their own or spot obvious traps.",storyline,,,,,

"Unfortunately, with the emphasis on spiritualism and violent action, it's more of an advertisement for neo-paganism and the supporting the unfortunate notion of fighting just wars over patches of land.As for fantasy though and in the belief that nearly every movie should be taken with a grain of reality salt, I give Avatar a big thumbs up in the fables department and it's well worth a 3D Imax viewing.",storyline,,,,,

"Quentin Tarantino returns better than ever!Inglourious Basterds is in my opinion his most mainstream film but without forgetting his roots,it might not be his best film but is literally a great movie.It is extremely funny,very smart,with great quotes and characters.All the basterds are great on their roles,Waltz won rightfully an Oscar and in general everybody is very good on his role,directing is as always great,so is the scenario.Like",storyline,,,,,
"In Cobb's world this is the continual emergence of Mab, and also of his children, and at one point, the train that goes flying through the middle of the city street.",storyline,,,,,

"If this is humanity's best then society in 2093 must of degraded to medieval times.I could point out all the other minor flaws like David's (Michael Fassbender) motivations and the inability of Vickers (Charlize Theron) to run to the side of a huge rolling spaceship, but from the reviews I've already read, that's already been covered.The",storyline,,,,,

"That is correct.However, in battle of good vs bad, unless at least one or two so called ""Elites"" could start to question themselves, and realize they lack the basic human traits, there is no hope.In a movie that touches the subject that this movie does, I would have liked some hope.Now getting away from the bigger subject, and concentrating on the plot itself, in the end the two ""tributes"" from the District-12 are encouraged to fake love (at least the girl is) so some ""Elites"" would root for them.",storyline,,,,,
"It has a good narrative and terrific music, and, in fact, looks very much like a well-made video-clip.This being a Fantasy film, you expect the unexpected and you are already open to unbelievable things to happen; however, to swallow the lot, the story needs to have an internal logic that makes it organic, and you rarely find that here beyond the opening sequence and the thin line connecting the different day-dreams.",storyline,,,,,

"John Connor should be a man laid heavy by the burden of being prophesied the saviour of mankind and frustrated at not being taken seriously by the Resistance command but they waste that aspect of the character and fail to capitalise on that concept, Bale just seems to be doing his gruff angry voice routine once again.",storyline,,,,,
Maybe Alan Moore was right after all.Verdict,storyline,,,,,
"I don't consider myself the slow Joe in the last row, nor is my Girlfriend is that slow Jane but honestly each of us got maybe 25% of the story, half the film made sense when we discussed it later.Maybe",storyline,,,,,

"It didn't had to waste it's time inventing stuff or stretching scenes because their was plenty to work with here: *SPOILERS* The good is that so far all the important scenes have been put into the movie (except one in my mind).The bad is divided into two sections: what's missing and what replaced it.First off, the Dursleys cameo was disappointing.",storyline,,,,,
"The plot is more over the top and muddled than ever with a plethora of pointless characters and incoherent nonstop action sequences, but Director Rob Marshall (Chicago) creates a film that will please fans and revive people's love for the series that was lost because of the previous two flops.",storyline,,,,,
"It is a futuristic, semi-post-apocalyptic story where an oppressive government stages a horrifying gladiator match between 24 children once per year.",storyline,,,,,

"Director and co-scripter Gary Ross keeps the gruesome reality of kill-or-be-killed as mostly an undercurrent in the early goings, letting momentum take hold of what could have easily become maudlin.Ross's strength lies in the quiet moments, which benefit from being just that.",storyline,,,,,
I also could find nothing to take away from movie and I don't think I can say that about any other Liam Neeson movie that I have ever seen.,storyline,,,,,
"This film presents to us an amazing story of survival and human will in the face of certain death, expertly delivered by director Danny Boyle and Best Actor nominee James Franco.I make the point to not divulge too many plot details in my reviews, but I feel an exception can be made in this case, since the story is so well known.",storyline,,,,,
"Ben Affleck does double duty as director and, plays Doug McCray, also known as the Architect, because he plans the heists with absolute precision, so that no one gets hurt and they don't get caught.",storyline,,,,,
"However, since the books are in the first person narrative, the emotion of the story was not conveyed as well I it could have been, but how would someone convey that without a fully narrated movie, which would become irritating?",storyline,,,,,

A little on the long side.,storyline,,,,,
"Surely a movie like Contagion has some zombies, right?",storyline,,,,,
"When all is said and done, the movie can be summed up in 3 words: Crash, Boom, Bang.Forgettable, which is a shame since Part 1 started out nicely.",storyline,,,,,
"Christian overtones are spread throughout, and at the very beginning of the film, it is stated that a man has two ways through life, which are the way of nature and the way of grace.",storyline,,,,,
But what makes it a great film rather than a great fun but forgettable experience is a near (spoiler alert) heartbreaking moment about 1 hour 25 minutes into the film.,storyline,,,,,
You really need to take the film as a whole and not whine about how individual elements have been done elsewhere.NOT,storyline,,,,,

"Britt, played by Seth Rogen in a strange yet fitting role, inherits the company and meets one of his fathers employees, Kato, who is skilled in weaponry, cars, and martial arts.",storyline,,,,,
"It's also deals with the perils of getting too absorbed into a role to the point of obsession, having that line that separates reality and fantasy get really blurred, to the detriment of the self-absorbed thespian, and here we observe Nina's horrific metamorphosis from all things good to a mean, and psychotic even, streak.One of the highlights of the film is how layered Andre Heinz's story is, taking place on many planes and even running parallel to that in real life with Natalie Portman taking on an adult role, and of course that between her character Nina and the Swan Queen in Swan Lake.",storyline,,,,,
The montage is jarring only because it has no connection to the scenes that immediately precede it.,storyline,,,,,
"When viewed in the context of where the film fits into the Star Trek universe, I'd have to say that it can be watched after the conclusion of all the previous productions, but still serve as a prequel to the Original Series.",storyline,,,,,

"There is nothing ordinary about this extraordinary expose, and the way Fincher and Sorkin skewer Facebook's creator as well as many of the people around him is a treat.",storyline,,,,,
"The cut back to her and her BF in bed is much too sudden and that follow-up scene is too short).All in all, this is horror film every bit worth your desire to have the bejesus scared out of you.",storyline,,,,,
"It supports the action more then leading it, which is a good thing.",storyline,,,,,
"I have read that some theatergoers are leaving the movie with serious depression issues, wanting to leave our world to live on a planet like Pandora.The story is simple, perhaps too simple, and themes like these have already been seen, but the movie is enchanting and the technical achievements and cinematography outstanding.",storyline,,,,,
"Like the one review saying ""there will be blood, lots of blood"" ???",storyline,,,,,
"I won't say I disliked watching the movie, and there were a number of moments that made me actually laugh out loud (something I'm not typically wont to do alone in a dark room).",storyline,,,,,
"Rorschach's is through the dialogue in his journal, Jupiter is through the flashbacks she has, Mr Manhattan is through his own internal thoughts and reminiscence.",storyline,,,,,
"Sadly too few films elicit such a long lasting debate as to its meaning and merit, forgotten as the house light rise and we return to mundane normality.",storyline,,,,,
I was wrong The movie has great lines with a lot of humor (Stark talking with Loki which was awesome and funny or when Hulk smashed Loki around after a small chat) a lot of action which is delivered throughout the movie under certain circumstances and not randomly which would ruin it.,storyline,,,,,

"I can buy that people could be conditioned over time with watching tough warrior adults killing each other on Reality TV, that's why Arnold Schwarzenegger's The Running Man is a good flick because it could ring true.",storyline,,,,,
"I don't know if I'm the only one to make this comparison, but I can't avoid that.Both movies has no unnecessary introduction or explications, just throws the watcher in the middle of storyline.",storyline,,,,,
"Also, you feel like the characters views have changed by the end of the movie, feeling completely satisfied with where we leave the characters.The story is handled with a great deal of thought and is able to juggle various subplots with care and never making them too overwhelming.",storyline,,,,,
"Transformers 2 has some comic moments, some exciting moments and even some sad moments, but not enough of these pockets of quality to fill the two and a half hour run-time.",storyline,,,,,

If its an alternate reality then by the definition of the word ALTERNATE you can't rely on it being even marginally similar to your reality.,storyline,,,,,
"However, Malick's slow and deliberate pacing does in fact peel back these layers a little at a time, so that when the emotional climax does arrive, it is genuinely moving in a way that so few films are nowadays.",storyline,,,,,
"Like Woody Allen in Midnight in Paris, Scorsese too chooses the inter- war Paris as the movie's backdrop, but unlike Allen, Scorsese's love for Paris seems rather unbiased, as he chooses to represent the city of love in the microcosm of an ever bustling railway station, occasionally punctuated by quick bursts of joy and sadness.",storyline,,,,,
"I enjoy the occasional turn-off-your-brain fun summer film, but the amount of fun I got from this movie is ridiculous and was certainly not anticipated.",storyline,,,,,
Amazing and beautiful film story.,storyline,,,,,
"Having experienced Ridley Scott's two previous historical forays in cinema (GLADIATOR, which I loved, and KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, which I enjoyed), I was eager to see his latest movie, a version of a much-loved legend.",storyline,,,,,
"Aronofsky has been very keen to reveal to the audience very early in the film that what they are about to see is an inner metamorphosis of the main character, but what he reserves revealing is just how wild exhilarating the ride will be.",storyline,,,,,
"Bay's sense of humor is just dirt level, unintelligent and he just shoves as much stuff on screen as possible.",storyline,,,,,
"I liked the film, but more so because of my having read the book, I don't feel as though I would have been as understanding of the running time and the lulls in the action sequences, otherwise.",storyline,,,,,
"As it has always happened, the movie's center is the relationship between the old man and the little boy, but director Peter Docter (""Monsters Inc.""), co-director Bob Peterson (who also voices the film's two funniest characters) and their writing team drive ""Up"" away from every sentimentalism in this particular aspect.",storyline,,,,,
"It's as if the script writers were raised on using the F word in every sentence, every character used the ill fated word in every line they spoke.",storyline,,,,,

There's a lot of filler.,storyline,,,,,
"would still recommend this movie, its a good popcorn muncher.",storyline,,,,,
"All the little things in the film are wrong, amazingly a super intelligent wargames AI is unable to triangulate a radio signal, the dialogue between characters is extremely limited, there is no character development and it gives no indication of any emotional connection with each other, the humans are using technology solutions against a vastly superior technological force, Skynet exhibits an emotional response about a small pointless video screen being destroyed...Again I could still extend my suspension of disbelief past all the little problems if the major elements were OK.Unfortunately everything about this screams poor writing.",storyline,,,,,
After Nero's appearance the movie died for me.,storyline,,,,,

I attended the screening in 3D and I honestly have no idea why people had anything bad to say about the 3D in this movie as it was quite brilliant.,visual,,,,,
"I'm sure most of the budget went to special effects and caused the shortening of the movie, but it could really have used an extra 20 minutes.",visual,,,,,
"This was just insulting and lazy!...I could go on, for a LONG time but this review has a limited word count & I simply cant fit in anymore than a fraction of my annoyance!Like many others have said it is beautifully set out to start with and the visuals are stunning (which is why it gets 2 stars) but it loses the plot fast and never looks like it wants to rejoin the rest of us opting for it's own LSD fueled trip to Narnia instead.",visual,,,,,

"graphic novel adaptation craze, started by Robert Rodriguez with 2005's Sin City, is still alive and kicking, as evidenced by Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch, which from the opening already appears slightly lost in a case of style over substance, with the blurry, grungy cinematography and deep, heavy goth soundtrack not promising much in the way of an engaging story.",visual,,,,,

The cinematography and editing are praiseworthy too.,visual,,,,,
It certainly is one of the most visually impressive films ever made.,visual,,,,,

"Thor was an impressive film to say the least, their were however a few flaws which if avoided could have made the film a lot better, for example the biggest and most thrilling action scene was right at the beginning, not allowing any other scene in the film to possibly beat it, already setting up the audience for a massive disappointment through the rest of the film.",visual,,,,,

"Ultimately, the score for The Artist is the most broadly appealing, which boosted it's odds at winning (plus, the audience was paying more attention to the music, being a silent film).",visual,,,,,
"Also, the music really gave the movie a good sense of time.",visual,,,,,
Did I mention the visual effects yet?,visual,,,,,
From the out of place eighties-esque synth pop soundtrack to the equally out of place large pink title cards this movie is a mash up of 80's clichs and pretentious cinematography.,visual,,,,,
The use of CGI in this film is breathtaking and beautiful.,visual,,,,,

The cinematography was terrible during the first portion of the film and again later towards the end of the film.,visual,,,,,
Until then only mindless monologues and some beautiful imagery and that is what this film has in common with documentaries like 'Home' or 'Planet Earth'.,visual,,,,,
"The musical score was used with profusion and one wishes it used less accordion sound (do we have to be reminded this is Paris?). Talking of Paris it did seem digital at times in the background, and we scarcely notice sunshine or daylight in the film, leaving it with a studio feel (maybe intended?",visual,,,,,

Features top special effects towards the end and the way the main plot twist is revealed in small parts from the beginning and how all the pieces fall together towards the end is intelligent but not mind blowing.,visual,,,,,
I remember see the same CGI for Benjamin Button and it being done well enough for no one to notice anything awkward about it.,visual,,,,,
"There's also the ""shaky camera"" thing.",visual,,,,,
"The special effects here, not surprisingly, are quite good, especially the climactic destruction of the world and its rebirth elsewhere in the universe; and the music score by Marco Beltrami interestingly appropriates the ominous Allegretto movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 at a couple of points in the film as a musical prelude to the inevitable.KNOWING probably won't go down as being among the best science fiction films ever, let alone of the End Of The World variety, but it works well enough, and it has provoked a lot of consideration about the impact of science and religion on the future of humanity.",visual,,,,,
3. found myself thinking - this is the first CGI dominated film in which the CGI scenes trump the live actor scenes.,visual,,,,,
Also: don't be fooled; even though this was re-processed for a 3-D release there is practically no 3-D effects at all!,visual,,,,,
This is mainly due to a song score that besides being too long is not very good.Compounding this there are way too many scenes in slow-motion.,visual,,,,,

Cutting that but focusing on the wild video game quality of the John Carter characters and crazy universe is as bad of an idea as possible for a summer film.,visual,,,,,
"In its attempt to outdo the first film with louder sound effects, more destructive explosions, bulkier robots and grander comedy relief, it fails to square off against the appeal of its predecessor: originality.",visual,,,,,
"Even better, he has managed to dodge the problem of not including the poetry and philosophy quotations by working extra hard on the soundtrack, picking a series of defining tunes that accompany the live-action treatment of Gibbons' illustrations.",visual,,,,,
"On the other hand, the special effects were pretty good and I liked it.",visual,,,,,
"Hans Zimmer's mind-blowing musical score and the wonderfully free, wide cinematography by Wally Pfister both give the film an epic scope which compliments the potential of dreams to transport us to a world beyond mundane reality.",visual,,,,,
Occasional tries sounds like tag-lines or slogans while being just plain unintelligent.,visual,,,,,
"a person not exposed to the ""Tintin"" series of comic novels in his younger age I went into the theaters with an open mind , excitation of watching a movie in 3D boosted by very nice things written & told about the movie in the media as well as word of mouth.The most striking & prominent thing that comes to once mind is that watching the first sequence only made one go speechless about the technical wizardry of the creators.",visual,,,,,
"I'd heard a lot of hype about Avatar, about its innovative technology and groundbreaking special effects, about all the anticipation, about the strong reviews and very strong opening weekend and Golden Globe nominations, and as much as I was intrigued, as much as I was wanting to see it, I was a little apprehensive.",visual,,,,,
It could have been improved with some cowboys on spaceships with lots of slave girls.,visual,,,,,
That was one of the most interesting aspects of the film; the locations.,visual,,,,,
I'd like to reach out to whom thinks that Avatar is just another big budget sci-fi blockbuster.,visual,,,,,
"While the movie avoids those big emotional scenes where the music swells up, there are amazing little touches, like a character's incomprehension of a loved one's death or a dying woman trying to help a fellow patient.",visual,,,,,
"Reportedly, it's the first movie ever photographed entirely by 3D cameras, whereas earlier 3D movies have all had 3D conversion done in some part in post production.",visual,,,,,

"Would have really enjoyed seeing how they stole the cop car, didn't have to be an elaborate chase scene with 10 cars following close behind like a Tony Scott or Michael Mann picture, just something for us to latch onto that's all.",visual,,,,,
Also the animation in the cartoon seemed...off.,visual,,,,,
"The poor end sequence in which we see the emergence of some form of early Alien, is a strange, unsatisfying and unnecessary link.",visual,,,,,
action in this film is good too.,visual,,,,,
one - the new Star Trek - is exciting but on the surface only.,visual,,,,,
In conclusion it looked good and it sounded great but it was all style and no substance.,visual,,,,,

"A plane has crashed (and exploded -- several times!), yet all the people seem to have got away with catching a little fire.",visual,,,,,

There are many enthralling scenes but the number of boring frames (particularly in the first half) is also abundant.,visual,,,,,

I ultimately walked out about 2 hours in (i think the scene where Blue guy takes Spandex chick to Mars).,visual,,,,,

"Its awesome and the best to come out of Hollywood.Firstly for people who haven't seen it (if that is possible), Avatar looks great!",visual,,,,,
The lighting and wide range of colors was well done and all around beautiful.,visual,,,,,
"Even though it does fly off the handle in the last twenty minutes or so, this is a solid little action film, and was a genuine surprise given I was expecting a generic and average shoot 'em up.",visual,,,,,
This movie was like the sci-fi channel doing a bad rip off of the cartoon.,visual,,,,,
This was a very enjoyable movie with breath-taking action sequences.,visual,,,,,
"Again I think this was a very valiant effort by McG, he needs to work out a couple kinks for the next films, which I really he gets the green light on.Basically",visual,,,,,
