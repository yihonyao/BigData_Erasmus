    "This file provides a template for **Assignment 1** from the Learning from Big Data course. This Jupyter Notebook file was prepared to save you time so that you can focus on the theory and technical parts of the methods seen in class. This was prepared with a specific application in mind: *movie reviews*. For the supervised learning tasks, we will focus on three topics: acting, storyline, and visual/sound effects. You have by now received the dataset of reviews, the three dictionaries with the training set of words for each topic, a list of stopwords, and a validation dataset containing sentences classified by a panel of human judges. This Jupyter Notebook file has a lot of (Python) code written to handle things such as leading these data files and general settings of the environment we use to perform the analysis. The supervised learning code in this file was covered in **Session 02**. This Jupyter Notebook file will load all the above-mentioned files and make them available for you to use them for solving the NLP problems listed here. The questions **you are to answer** are marked as \"`QUESTION`\". The parts **you are expected to code yourself** are marked as \"`# ADD YOUR CODE HERE`\". There, you are expected to write your own code based on the in-class discussions and the decisions you will make as you study the theory, material, and models."

    "We will explore the concepts from this problem set with a dataset of online movie reviews. The reviews were written from 2009 to 2013. The data was collected in 2014. Each observation in the data includes the textual review, a numerical rating from 1 to 10 (i.e., the number of stars), the movie title, the reviewer, and the date the review was written. The observation includes data from the moving being reviewed: the movie release data, the box office in the first week (as that is the strongest predictor of movie success), the studio that produced the movie, the number of theaters that the movie was released in, and the MPAA rating. The review also includes two pieces of information on the quality of the review itself: the number of readers who found the review useful, and the number of readers who rated the review as useful or not useful. There are reviews that no one rate as useful or not useful. The date in which a review was rated is not available."

    "\n",
    "- p-value (PR(>F)): The p-value associated with the F-statistic, indicating the probability of obtaining the observed F-statistic or a more extreme value, assuming the null hypothesis (no group differences) is true. Smaller p-values suggest stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- Raters: The p-value is extremely small (about 1.3e-07), indicating strong evidence that the number of raters significantly affects the outcome.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Adjusted R-squared: The adjusted R-squared is approximately -0.49. It's important to note that the adjusted R-squared can be negative when the model fits the data worse than a horizontal line. In this case, the negative value indicates that the model does not fit the data well and may not be appropriate for making predictions.\n",

    "In summary, the number of raters (raters) is the only significant factor affecting the outcome, while the other variables (prob_storyline, prob_acting, prob_sound_visual) do not significantly affect the outcome. However, the model overall does not fit the data well, as indicated by the unusual negative R-squared value and the high Mean Squared Error. Further investigation and potential model adjustments may be necessary."
