(500) Days of Summer,1,slowcloud,23/Jun/09,9,8.241902188877729e-07,film movie not story well even films time way life characters love just movies never two see heart people many ever real romantic take seen moments,0.831196581,468.0,inf,inf,5.407677873673569e+269," I haven't seen a romance this touching since I was the same type of single sad sack as depicted by the hero of (500) Days of Summer. Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has his radar up for ""the girl of his dreams"" when he meets Summer (Zooey Deschanel). Too bad for Tom Summer is stuck on friends-with-benefits mode. Let the tension begin.Director Marc Webb captures the feeling of innocent, na Ã®ve love expertly. Anyone who has taken the lyrics of the Smiths too closely to heart, would be moved by the idea of the person they are crushing on sing to them: ""To die by your side/is such a heavenly way to die."" No wonder Tom soon falls head over heels for this girl.As events unfold out of sequence, you know all along Tom has fallen for a time bomb of a woman, and he can't even see the countdown. When that bomb finally blows up in his face, it unfolds with powerful simplicity-- no exposition or dialog, just two juxtaposed events that capture the heartache of reality hitting a person who sees a person through the filter of some deep-seeded emotions that where planted at too young an age.So many romantic films nowadays concern themselves with cute ideas, take 'He's Just Not That Into You' or 'Serendipity' for example. Then there are movies like 'Knocked Up' where a pot-smoking, video-gaming playing narcissistic slob tries to turn his life around to try and be a father. These movies forget about real people. Who cares about stock or cartoonish characters in love. The couple in (500) Days of Summer have true chemistry. There are some beautiful, subtle moments of tenderness as well some heart-rending moments of disconnectedness between the two that never comes across as heavy-handed. The movie constantly reminds you that these are two different people with different ideas of a relationship, yet they stubbornly continue their dating, and they remain lovable all the same.An omniscient narrator sets the film up early on by noting ""this is not a love story,"" but few films ever capture the sensation of falling in love as well as this movie does.

We've all done our share of ""dumping"". Whether it's the, ""Lets just be friends,"" or the all too familiar, ""It's not you, it's me,"" tactic, as long as you're not on the receiving end it becomes a question of, ""How quickly can I get this over with, so I can move on with my life?"" Equally, all of us (yes even Brad Pitt) have experienced what it feels like to ""be"" dumped and the complex emotions that unexpectedly follow. If you're one of the fortunate souls that have managed to escape the throws of relationship hell, you'll probably fare better with renting the newest addition to the Rambo series. For the rest of you who've at one time or another gotten your hearts ripped out of your chests and stomped into a million pieces only to turn you into unshaven, alcoholic hermits on the brink of starvation__this movie is dedicated to you. Tom (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) is a wanna-be architect turned professional greeting card writer whose life is thrown for a loop when he suddenly falls for the ""new girl"" Summer (Zooey Deschanel, Almost Famous). As one who appeared most certainly unattainable at first glance, Tom manages to charm her into what she coins as a, ""casual relationship."" Eventually, Tom ends up questioning their status with one another, which manages to put strain on the relationship, causing her to request the dreaded ""time apart."" (500) Days of Summer chronicles the bitter sweet beginnings, the untimely endings and all of that confusing stuff that takes place during the in betweens of a relationship that just isn't meant to be.(500) Days of Summer is presented in an effective non-linear style that sets it apart from its romantic comedy predecessors, rotating back and forth between dates signified by a simple title card flashing in between scenes (2), (50), (150) and so on to represent the various days in the course of Toms roller coaster of a relationship. This seesaw method of bouncing to and fro successfully manages to force the viewer in a physically engaging shared experience of Tom's feelings, which is something every director aspires to elicit from their intended audience. The real kudos go to Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber, whose script is practically flawless. You can't help but feel that their authenticity and attention to detail while constructing each scene through appropriately sarcastic and funny dialogue exchanges among all of the main characters involved, particularly those between Deschanel and Levitt which come across as heartbreakingly real and genuine. Their creative way of crafting the simple concept of a break up through unconventional story structuring is a refreshing concept that begs to be seen more in a world where most conventional films tend to play it safe. Leads Deschanel and Levitt manage to bring something quite special to the screen in their portrayals of Tom and Summer (both ""last nameless""). Their chemistry is really what makes the film a joy to watch. Mostly thanks to Neustadter and Weber's superb dialog, both actors seem so comfortable in their roles that their interactions with one another transcend the screen and naturally unfold before our eyes as if we were voyeurs to their unraveling, wanting so much to change the fate of their outcome, but helpless to do so. Deschanel is sexy, carefree and bound to be adored by males everywhere as Summer. Levitt captures the struggle of the neurotic ""boy in love"" exceptionally through all of his various stages of emotional imbalance. (500) Days of Summer is a poem to every down and out guy who thinks he's the only one whose ever been dragged through the mill by their own Summer. What undoubtedly ends up making this picture so brilliant is how relatable it is to its victims and victimizers a like. When all is said and done, there is most definitely a lesson to be learned by Tom's experiences. Everyone you meet along the way, whether just passing through or sticking around for awhile, has a purpose. In the end nothing lasts forever, relationships begin, relationships end.

I think it's Love. How could you not love this movie, this a story about a guy named Tom who wants to be an architect but ends up working a meaningless job at a greeting card company creating romantical propaganda on paper. Luckily for him the most perfect girl in the world, Summer, just started working at his office and wouldn't you know it, she loves The Smiths, too. It's a match made in Ikea Heaven, but wait there is a twist here! This goddess of all things shabby chic doesn't believe in love, furthermore she doesn't want to be held down by a relationship. Oh No! Poor Tom. Those ocean blue eyes, that voice, that smile, those eyes.... oh those eyes, how could Tom not fall deeply in love with Summer. So begins the season of love, the 500 Days of Summer. In 500 amazing days Tom will learn about relationships, reconciliations (a good Ex never dies), Love, Lose and most importantly about moving forward.Now talk about great performances, this ones got two. You want Zooey, you got Zooey. She's all over this one, easily one of her top performances to date. She is simply truth in this movie, she'll make you love her and then she'll slowly break your heart but you'll just want to love her more until all you see are those glowing blue eyes in your loneliest nightmares. Joseph Gordon Levitt is so prime here, the chemistry between he and Zooey clicks perfectly and not only that but since every woman,man and child is in love with the knee bending powers of Ms. Deschanel it must be said that JGL gives such a strong performance that he clearly owns this movie all the way till the very end. You might come on down to the cinema looking for Zooey but you'll be rushing home to hit up the IMDb to see what the 3rd' Rock kids been up to over the last 8 ( hint... see 2005's Brick). While watching JGL's performance it's pleasantly reminiscent of a pre-Brokeback Heath. He has such a charm about him that glows and an easy smile that jumps off the screen, plus much like Heath he has the chops to take it dark and lonesome with sincerity if the flick requires. The rest of the cast rounds out nicely with a few supporting folks like Clark Gregg who plays Tom's square Boss and Geoffrey Arend who is good for a few good sidekick chuckles. By the way special shout out to Ian Reed Kesler who played the ""Douche"" (IMDBs words not mine) with perfection. That must have been an interesting audition call.. looking for 30-something dude to play the ""Douche"". Well Played Sir! Now the dynamic duo aside, Marc Webb the Director has got a little something-something going on. Past sins aside (directing Jesse McCartney videos, WTF?), it seems that his music video hipness lends a freshness and style to the overall appearance of this flick. The movie very rarely missed its mark and by golly its got real DEPTH!. Needless to say this makes it quite a bit more interesting then the latest McConaughey (dude what happened, you were so cool in Dazed) and Kate Hudson needs a paycheck mindless studio romance. You'll have lots to talk about and feelings to relive long after this ones stopped rolling the credits. Additional strong points here are a visual aesthetic that has a modern meets Capraesque remix, which felt very much built around Zooey Deschanel's fabulous style. The colors and landscape are all complimentary to the movie, downtown LA never looked so nice! The other thing we got going on here is a killer soundtrack, built around some Smiths, Doves, and a few others, not mention the fact that once again we get a chance to hear Zooey Deschanel do a little karaoke in the movie which is a tasty little treat.Bottom line 500 Days is going to be on your mind in 2009 and chances are that like a good EX it will always pop back in your life and you'll dust if off and pop it in the player and go down memory lane remembering all good stuff, then like a swift punch in the gut like only a good EX can, it'll break your heart all over again.See it, believe it.

It's a time for friends, family, and fun. Ballgames, barbecues, amusement parks, and movies, summer is just a time to sit back, relax and enjoy. Enjoy time off, good weather and whatever else it might bring. Am I missing something? Oh yes, love. Summer is a time for love.The film can be pretty much summed up in one of the first lines of the film. ""This is a story of boy meets girl. But you should know up front, this is not a love story."" But is it? 500 Days of Summer is not your typical romantic film. There's something to it, something more than your usual romantic comedy. Maybe it's the style it's done? Maybe it's the realistic nature? Maybe it's the wonderful music? Maybe its the beautiful cinematography? Maybe, its Tom and Summer...Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are the leads, Tom and Summer. These are real everyday people. Tom, a believer in true love. Summer, a doubter. Which reminds me of one particular scene where Summer questions Tom about believing in love. Tom replies, ""It's love, it's not Santa Claus."" It is a real thing, a crazy little thing called love. Tom falls in love with Summer from the start. She doesn't. Tom is like every other guy, and every guy knows of a girl like Summer. The girl they want, but can't have. They try, to no avail. It's frustrating, and Tom is frustrated. He's happy then sad. He doesn't know what to think. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel have great chemistry together and give solid performances. You really believe their relationship and hardships. It makes you notice the little things in relationships. The film highlights two young stars on the rise. With some great performances lately for Joseph Gordon-Levitt, his stock is rising... dare I say an up and coming Heath Ledger? The story is not in direct order as it goes back and forth from different days Tom remembers his life and relationship with Summer. When remembering, we may not remember every detail in order. We choose what we want to remember. May that be the good, or the bad. For Tom, it's a little bit of both. Big props to the editing department. The film shows the good and the bad of love, relationships, and life. There's something about it that sets it apart from the usual romantic comedy.500 Days of Summer is really refreshing now a days. It's funny, unique, and true to life. It's got something for everybody to like. Director Marc Webb shines in his feature film debut. I'm interested to see where he goes from here. 500 Days of Summer has quickly become a late summer highlight for me and surprisingly so at that.

Still, we are so preconditioned by Hollywood, that directive merely floated around in my head until near the end of the film when I realized it was perfectly accurate.Joseph Gordon-Levit and Zooey Deschanel are the leads and each bring a certain quirkiness and sensitivity to their roles. Watching them grow as a couple just never quite clicks for the viewer the way it does for JGL's character. He buys in hook, line and sinker and believes his destiny for love is being fulfilled by Summer (Zooey).Director Marc Webb throws a bit of everything at us - just to prove this is not a traditional love story. We get the fun of memory blender - flashbacks like Day 488, Day 2, Day 159 - well you get the point. That is how most of us remember anyway: non-linear. We also get a funny musical number in the park, a b & w Bergmanesque dramatization, and a leading man whose poetic musings are limited to his writing quips for a greeting card company. Oh, he also takes love advice from his 11 year old soccer-playing sister (Chloe Moretz), but wisely declines most of it from his best friend played by sexist, drunken (and funny) co-worker, Geoffrey Arend.What I really like about the film is that it is different, yet very realistic.

The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New Jersey, grew up believing that he'd never truly be happy until the day he met the one. This belief stemmed from early exposure to sad British pop music and a total mis-reading of the movie 'The Graduate'. The girl, Summer Finn of Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share this belief. Since the disintegration of her parent's marriage she'd only love two things. The first was her long dark hair. The second was how easily she could cut it off and not feel a thing. Tom meets Summer on January 8th. He knows almost immediately she is who he has been searching for. This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know upfront, this is not a love story."" 500 Days of Summer is an intriguingly original take on falling in love. Every emotion involved with a relationship seems to be relayed; from the strange and quirky aspects of new love to the tragedy of heartbreak. Marc Webb deftly incorporates his ingenuity and comedy into the film. The writers quite skilfully enrich the film with one of the most immensely beautiful and original screenplays to come along in a while.Tom, a greeting-card writer with artistic dreams beyond his mundane job, meets Summer and quickly falls for her. Eventually, he manages to charm her into a ""casual relationship"". So begins the 500 days that chronicle the happiness, heartbreak, and every other aspect involved with the often changing tides of romance.500 Days of Summer portrays a relationship that is more realistic and less clich Ãd than most others in it's woefully unoriginal and formulaic genre. In doing so, the film never feels anything less than completely innovative and incredibly fun. The film's story is told in a refreshingly non-linear fashion that strives for and often reaches perfection with each and every scene.The acting is wonderful, especially from the two leads. Since starring in Mysterious Skin (a disturbingly compelling film), Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been one of my favorite actors and proves yet again why he is one of the most talented actors of his generation. His performance was truly fantastic. Zooey Deschanel is absolutely wonderful in her portrayal of Summer and her quirky personalities. Their chemistry is wondrously compelling to watch and their moments together seem wholly convincing and genuine. The supporting cast is terrific throughout and very fun to watch. The music was marvelous and really added to the film. Everyone involved does an amazing job to connect the several elements of love into a satisfying and moving conclusion. The film often shuffles between whimsy and realistic, but, rather than getting lost because of it, the story only seems to be enhanced due to the chaotically transitional moods.500 Days of Summer is a hilarious, deftly thoughtful film about love. The performances are astonishing and the writing is sublime. It is a thoroughly clever and impressive film that shouldn't be missed.

In January 2009 I was able to attend the Sundance Film Festival where I viewed a number of superb movies but none so genius as this one. Unable to buy or book any tickets for the original showings I sadly set my thoughts on other films, till the last day. I had changed plans and went to the ticket office to exchange one movie ticket for another. It was then that I discovered they planned to screen another showing of 500 Days of Summer, due to its immense popularity. Immediately buying a ticket, I found myself in the theater a few hours later awaiting with batted breath. I looked around me and watched as Joseph Gorden Levitt took a seat in the row behind, smiling and shaking hands with a number of fans. Although I too was a great fan I couldn't bring myself to go over there, instead I stayed in my seat and the movie started.An hour and a half later, I was standing up and applauding for all I was worth. In fact the whole cinema was, with every single audience member whistling, clapping and laughing at the brilliance of it all. Then Joseph Gorden Levitt, (the only cast member of the film who showed up) ran on stage and started answering questions. Bubbling with enthusiasm he jumped around, laughing, yelling, and keeping the lot of us entertained. He answered the straight questions with straight answers and the silly questions with straight out of hell silly answers. And at the end ran up and down the stage filming us all with a camcorder, saying he'd remember the day forever, I sure do.Then he went back to his seat and as everyone exited the cinema I swallowed my pride, walked up and shook his hand saying, ""Amazing performance, you're an inspiration."" Then it was over, I found myself being shuffled with the crowd out of the theater and into the cold outside. But even though I was in a t-shirt, I couldn't feel the chill, being instead caught up in the entertainment and thoughts of a vibrant funny film. A film that scores high in all the boxes and one I will certainly see again.100 out of 100. ","    story  boy meets girl,    not  love story  will unfurl.

I was surprised to walk out of the theater annoyed at what seemed like an adolescent take on romantic love. Maybe part of the problem is that I recently watched Annie Hall. Like many other filmic treatments of love, 500 days seems derived from Annie Hall. There are Bergman references, cartoon characters, split screens, direct address of the audience which all smell and feel like the classic. Even the Deschanel character seems like a flat, more one dimensional,cynical version of Annie (she doesn't hold a candle to Diane Keaton, no where near the charm and far more disturbed) delivering conversation ending platitudes like ""what always happens...life."" (oooh, that's deep). Sis far more a caricature than anything else. I would lay bets her marriage ends in divorce and that she is much more pathological than the film lets you in on. The Joseph-Gordon Levitt character also seems unsophisticated and puerile. Although he is charming in his role, he is never in anything approaching love with this woman; he remains mired in his projections and idealizations of her and we are forced to watch this painful display of 14 year old obsession. I think by the end he gets it, but by then you have had to suffer right along with him. He is also not spared the stultifying writing {the quitting his job speech where he decides he's not going to be part of the ""bulls**t"" any longer) that makes this move sound like a grown ups Say Anything.I guess that was my main problem with the movie. It just doesn't really seem to have anything intelligent or important to say about love. These people didn't seem credible to me, they lacked depth and maturity. In the 32 years that have elapsed since Annie Hall it seems that our culture has gotten more childish and superficial and less, not more, understanding of love. Maybe that is what is most disappointing to me; that this is what we have to say about the subject. If that is the case no wonder people are so emotionally stunted when it comes to relationships. And lastly, I just couldn't buy the whole LA thing. Why try so hard to make LA look like New York? Who takes the train, the subway and the bus? I mean, isn't LA good enough as it is without tying to make it look urban in the traditional sense?

One of them being I've been very unsure of how exactly I feel about this movie.Critics and average movie goers have praised this movie immensely. It has been described by professional critics as ""a delightful comedy, alive with invention"" among other (positive) things. This specific statement is right about the movie being innovative. We have all seen, heard and read the overdone 'boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gains girl again'. But this is more like 'boy meets girl, boy loses girl... for good'. Going back to the statement :'a delightful comedy'? I think not. There is almost nothing funny about this movie. The supposed 'funny' parts are basically swearing...ummm...yep that's it. The other parts were way too depressing or 'touchy' to be perceived as humorous. Why this is branded as a romantic comedy I will never understand. If it were up to me I would brand this as an anti-romance movie more than anything. I will not go into the plot too much but I can tell you that the movie makes me sick even thinking about the concept of romance and love. How Summer (the girl) is perceived by Tom (the boy) as her soul mate and how it definitely seems that way in the beginning of their relationship. How it feels like they're 'in love'. And how Tom is pretty much stabbed and mentally abused when Summer suddenly described she's not interested. The popular 'Expectations/Reality' scene in which, on one side of the screen, Tom gains summer back (the expectations) and on the other side of the screen, where he is completely ignored by her (the reality). And of course the ending, which I won't spoil, all of these aforementioned factors combined together make me sick to my inner core.I will commend the movie for being original, not following a generic romance movie formula. And this is probably more realistic than just about all movies in the same vein. But... I just can't like it. It just disgusts and frustrates me way too much. Underneath all the sunny sunshine presentation of the movie, there is too much darkness and depression. And I'm not saying that this is a necessarily a bad thing. It's just that, the way it's portrayed doesn't click with me. It felt me leaving very hollow and unhappy.Then again, I am rating this more than I would rate a typical romance/drama and I'm not a fan of this genre so considering that this is a good rating. If you're into the romance genre check it out. Perhaps it's just my interpretation that's making me feel so disgusted at the movie. Like I said in my title, my views on this are pretty confused.

What could go wrong?Nothing. Or so I thought. I actually wanted to see this movie. And, despite the annoyingly sporadic bursts of applause from an overenthusiastic moviegoer, I actually didn't find it too bad. But then I watched it again. I missed the first 5 minutes, see. The longer I thought about this movie, the more I found it disturbing.""Any resemblance to people living or dead is purely accidental...Especially Jenny Beckman...Bitch.""This movie is really about hate, revenge, and why you shouldn't date fun, interesting, and unique women.For a movie that mentions the word 'love' more times than any movie I've seen before, it has hardly anything to substantial or significant to say about this elusive idea. Oohhhhh, so it takes TWO people to fall in love! Really?! Is that news?

He is simply the proverbial dick in the glass case. Break glass in case of emergency. Zooey's character Summer on the other hand, inspires Tom to pursue his life's ambition to become an architect. And he even ends up with the drop-dead Minka Kelly (who receives unusually high credits for gorgeously appearing for less than 5 minutes) as a result. So despite his bitching, Tom actually came out of it better than, perhaps, Summer. The audience doesn't even see who Summer ends up marrying...the writers know they can't justify it, besides, they've built Tom up too much already. So they just leave it at some lame encounter in a caf Ã where some random schmo comments on an Oscar Wilde book she's reading.

The film's plot concerns an employee for a greeting card company (Tom) who can't escape his previous relationship with a girl named Summer, played by the talented Zooey Deschanel. Bits and pieces of their relationship are presented to the film viewer__out of sequence__as Tom tries to discover why everything fell apart, what he can do to get Summer back, and if love actually exists. I know. It sounds bland, but this one has several elements that push it far beyond the run-of-mill.First, the acting is simply incredible. As I said before, Levitt wowed me with his spot-on Sam Spade impersonation in Rian Johnson's homage to noir films: Brick. In (500) Days however, Levitt sheds his hard boiled detective act and trades it in for the sensitivity and bitterness of Holden Caufield. The sensitive male role is a performance that's often exaggerated to the point where the audience often finds themselves annoyed__and even hating__the character. Levitt's Tom never losses his sympathetic appeal even when his obsession verges on obnoxious behavior in the latter part of the film.Zooey Deschannel is incredible as a thinly veiled Annie Hall clone__Summer. She's the product of a broken home, independent, blunt with her sexuality and incredibly beautiful. This could have been such a simple role to botch. Nothing that Summer says is particularly witty or catchy, but Deschannel (just as Diane Keaton with Annie Hall) manages to make her such an intriguing character through her physical presence . Summer is not only a character that must be watched, but one that must also be read. She must be read through her facial expressions, how she moves her body, and__especially__how she looks at Tom when she's speaking to him or he is speaking to her.The actors aren't the only ones who should be praised. Marc Webb does quite an impressive job with his directorial debut__probably the best since Zach Braff's Garden State. This story could have easily fallen to pieces in the hand of even a seasoned director but Webb rises to the challenge with the talent of virtuoso. The cinematography is never over-the-top or artsy just for the sake of being artsy. Every shot, every angle, and every neat little trick that Webb employs has its purpose. Hopefully, this film marks the beginning of a young and talented auteur's superb career.I feel that it would be wrong not to mention the soundtrack. After all, Tom's attraction to Summer blossoms when she displays her knowledge of the Smith's catalog. The experience simply would not be nearly as enthralling without the music. Every song serves its accompanying scene splendidly and helps the viewer connect with the two leads. I would say that it's even better than the Juno and Garden State soundtracks simply because those soundtrack are more like stellar mix CDs than anything else__there is no theme or running emotion connecting the songs together. (500) Days is a different story. You can almost decipher the story just from listening to the soundtrack. The beginning tracks that deal with the yearning for a crush and the utter joy of ending up with that crush, the middle section of the CD that encompasses the fading of the joy and the eventual disintegration of the relationship, and the final portion of the soundtrack that deals with recovery from and acceptance of the lost relationship. Ultimately, it's an emotion provoking selection of music that's as vital to the movie as the acting and the directing. I would argue that (500) Days of Summer is destined to become a modern classic film, ranking along side Milk, There Will Be Blood, Garden State, Children of Men, American Psycho, and Little Miss Sunshine. Why? It's not because it's a particularly quotable film or that it's an innovative movie with some neat camera tricks. Instead, I think it will because it has a soul. It's a movie that takes a snapshot of love in the modern world and bravely presents it without removing any of the blemishes.

Honesty was a big problem with this movie. One person thought honesty opened a direct line to an excuse for escape, while another relied on honesty to cement the relationship that this movie was about. And it was that cement that took this relationship to the bottom. For me, honesty means I am stuck with telling the truth about my feelings for this movie. I am terribly disappointed. In one word, B-O-R-I-N-G.I can never say anything bad about Zooey Deschanel but I hated her character, Summer Finn. At first sight she was cute but one moment later, there was a sense of danger for this charming beauty. She obviously stood out as standoffish at that point but later weakened and became deliciously accessible. It was a cycle that repeated more than a couple times in the movie. I have seen this kind of flipping before and nothing good ever came of it.I have so little to say about Tom because, well, he was indeed the whipping post he was made out to be.While there are so many positive comments about this movie, I have to admit I do not see it. To me this movie was a clinical observation on the process of love - nothing inspirational. Whatever hope you may have for either of the main characters, it is quickly made obvious that only one character deserves the benefits of hope...the whipping post. This movie did more to separate one of the hope for, need and meaning of love than to encourage the feelings of love.If you want to see a reality tainted yet soul-immersing movie that draws someone into the world where love is something that hurts and heals, see About Last Night. It's an oldie but it is what I hoped this movie would be similar to.I give this a 4 out of 10 and all points go to Zooey. ","  trying  determine   will write  review,  decided  start   honesty.

This is one of those rare films where everything lined up perfectly and the results are stunning. Where do you start with a movie this good? Anywhere! Memories: They come to us out of order. We remember endings, and then we remember beginnings. We remember last month, then last year, then yesterday. Sometimes we revel in our memories. Sometimes they kick us in the stomach. And that is how this story is told to brilliant effect. Out of chronological order. And, from the front car of a speeding roller coaster. This is a SWEET film!!! And it could not have been cast better than with Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt. Deschanel plays Summer Finn. She's alluring and desirable while maintaining a flat, detached affect that only makes her more desirable to all who come in contact with her. Words float from her mouth when she speaks as if to denote a subtle indifference. Holding her hand could cause yours to feel empty. Like holding the hand of a ghost. It's her way to be there, and not be there. She likes it that way. It's safe. Deschanel is brilliant at this and totally believable as Levitt's, unattainable, object of desire. Levitt is wonderfully lost in love for this ""perfect"" girl. He is confused, bedazzled, and depressed - he's in love. He navigates all of the roller coaster stages of his characters head on collision with love with deftness and poignancy. I can not imagine any two other actors doing this movie greater justice. There are so many good moments in this movie it might be inappropriate to single out just one over the plethora of others. But I will anyway. It is a beautifully subtle scene with Summer and Tom sitting in a theater watching the final scene of the movie ""The Graduate"" with Dustin Hoffman and Katherine Ross. Hoffman and Ross have escaped the chaotic world around them. It's just the two of them now, holding hands, moving ahead into the sunset. Seeing this, Summer (Deschanel), becomes emotional, surprising both herself and Tom. What happens in those few moments is at the heart of this film. And it's importance could almost go by unnoticed because it's done so delicately. As this moment is unfolding we already know everything about Tom. He has no secrets. From the start of this film his chest cavity is wide open with his beating heart on full display. Summer, on the other hand, is all secrets. But when the clock strikes this moment, we learn one of them. It's sweet. It's sad. It's revealing. And, I thought, very powerful because it changes everything we think we know about her up to this point. It also sets up perfectly the beautiful, but perhaps not ""happy"", ending that is soon to come.In the opening credits, the narrator explains that this is a ""boy meets girl"" story, but that it's not a ""love story"". Well, I don't know about that. I think this is a love story. And a good one. The script is genius. The direction is sharp but never heavy handed. The music plays through the action in perfect accompaniment with the story. There is nothing not to like about this gem. Everyone in the world has lived through this relationship at some point in their life. It's the one that makes you stronger, as it almost kills you. Yes, that one. Here's what it looks like as a movie. A good movie.

The couple meet, get to know one another, date, and part in the course of five-hundred days, while director Marc Webb zips us through different stages of their relationship in a semi-random manner (which Webb probably intended as a fresh way to define the peaks and valleys of modern romance). Age-appropriate viewers, tired of Woody Allen or Nora Ephron-penned romantic comedy-dramas, will no doubt see traces of themselves portrayed earnestly here, yet the film is hardly inventive. The college-rock soundtrack is flavorful, and is usually around to pick up the slack, yet Neustadter and Weber fall back on some very derivative character-driven scenes and dialogue (while the proviso that leading lady Zooey Deschanel prefers being alone to dating is a lazy out, rendered inconsequential by the finale). The picture looks good and sounds good, though it is itself a fairy tale--one topped with a happy bow. Gullible teenagers are its target audience. ** from **** "," Scott Neustadter  Michael H.

In the beginning only the narrator bluntly says: ""She's who he's been searching for. This is a story about boy meets girl. But you should know that this is not a love story..""Whatever this may not be, this is a story about love. The feeling of true love is captured by the timelessness of the film. It only chronicles 500 days of Tom (Joseph Levitt) with Summer (the amazing Zooey Deschanel). The first time director Marc Webb gives a story that is too real. The dialogues are not so memorable and you can't actually quote it, but it is an amazing narration with its back & forth story-telling. Though the film is in IMDb's Top 250, I don't think it deserves to get into it because there are way more films which are more better than this.The friends of Tom were caricatures, but I loved his sister Rachael (Chloe Moretz). She was a breath of fresh air in this film. And there is a Bollywood song and dance routine in the film when Tom spends the night with Summer. I am an Indian and I do like some dance and songs in Indian films. I don't go to see a Hollywood movie to see our style of dance. You may like the song and dance in the film, but I didn't like it. Summer's character could have been better etched out. Why did she leave him when she told him she was happy with him? She has a commitment phobia, but this vanishes in the ending for some trite reason. Zooey is a very likable person in all her movies and I love the way her eyes are - all big & blue like the ocean. She can also act and she and Levitt are going to have very good careers in Hollywood. And the cinematography was excellent. I heard the director was a video song director and his creativity shows in every frame. I couldn't end this without talking about the songs. What a glorious infusion of music in the story. All the songs were good and fit perfectly. If one hears the soundtrack, you can almost guess the story.

So strong and powerful was my emotional reaction and connection to this film, it could in many ways alter forever my view of relationships. Is that good or bad? As an indie-budget production, there are really only two sections that can make or break this type of film: writing and acting. The script by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber is as close to perfect as I've ever seen in any film of any genre. The dialogue feels completely accurate and true to the context of the situations of the characters, the situations themselves are real and totally believable and the nonlinear narrative works extremely well in bringing the audience not only into a deeper sympathy with the Joseph Gordon-Levitt character but also in convincing us that a number of these scenes may be dreams. First-time director Marc Webb keeps the tricks to a minimum, using only what is necessary to support the story and not divert from it. The film is tight in its pace, which builds the tension and emotion all the more.This now brings us to the acting which is, needless to say, flawless. Gordon-Levitt has been a star-in-the-making for a while now but combining this performance with his in Christopher Nolan's Inception proves he is truly one of the best young actors of this generation. He so perfectly handles both the funny and serious moments of Tom Hansen's journey through love, completely believable in every single frame. He is a nice guy so we root for him, but his pain is visceral and tender so we identify with him. He creates one of the best protagonists I have ever seen in a movie. Zooey Deschanel is an actress I have loved ever since she played the perky, blonde singing elf in Elf. However, her game has been raised significantly from such trash as Failure to Launch. She creates a sympathetic character as well but in an entirely different way. Summer is a woman with many events in her life that would lead to her feeling about relationships the way she does. Therefore, it is understandable that she would do what she does in this film. Yet, there is no excuse given to properly and completely understand who and why she does what she does. We only get glimpses; we see her through Tom's eyes and despite her great beauty and quirky personality, there is always the feeling that something deeper lingers below. Needless to say, the chemistry between the two leads is something to behold. It may be a stretch to compare them to legends such as Bogart/Bacall or Grant/Hepburn but I felt completely comfortable and enchanted by both of them, together and individually.Getting down to it, why is this quite simply the best portrayal of relationships ever put to celluloid? Many would question that statement and it may not be true, but it is most certainly true for this generation that Tom and Summer represent. Here are two people on different paths that happen to cross. Is it fate or coincidence? Each has different views of that and by the end their views are slightly askew. The film would say that it's a little of both. I think that is the best statement the writers and director could make. I have heard many detractors of the film say that it is too sad, that Summer is an unsympathetic person and the ending is completely false. I would simply remark that life is quite often too sad, Summer is sympathetic in a much different way than most romantic-comedy girls and the ending rang true in the sense that Tom's journey isn't over. Many, if not all, guys have been in Tom's shoes. This makes it the best story about love for guys. It also makes it the type of film that when you see it, you feel changed inside.The vast majority of films in this genre are totally dead and unrealistic. Films like Adventureland and 500 Days of Summer show that with the right script and the right cast, a story can be told that is funny, sad, smart and completely, utterly, totally, indubitably: perfect.

They liked the same songs, laughed at the same little things and were pretty happy portraying a recently-married couple in IKEA.But I was also 13 back then and only now, watching it again, did I really get it. Because it does teach a valuable lesson. One that destiny is what we make of it, that we may countdown our lives and close our eyes and chose to ignore anything but that person we've chosen to love because we are so hooked to them, but that that is a product of our (mis)conception that it is made to be when it might not. And only when we leave that behind and accept it and change things for the better do we, by accident, find happiness where we least expect it. And that's what makes this such a memorable movie.Aside from the aforementioned, it has great soundtrack - thumbs up! -, wonderful acting, smooth editing and, above all, a mesmerizing plot.

It's been done to death, with the small varieties of the same old formula trotted out every year. Fortunately '500 Days of Summer' is a giant breath of fresh air. Unlike the clich Ãd rom-com, it's not afraid to depict a realistic relationship: from the giddy early days, the painful breakup and everything in between, with the gorgeous Zooey Deschanel (Summer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Tom) as the leads.'500 Days' depicts Tom and Summer's relationship in a non-liner pattern, with numbered titles indicating the stage of their relationship. Tom is an optimistic believer in true love while Summer thinks relationships are a waste of time. This movie is in parts painful and hopeful. Tom falls madly in love with a woman who seems out his league (at least physically) and slowly cracks begin to appear in their relationship. A great example is comparable visits to a furniture store. In the early days of their relationship, Tom's jokes about all the appliances being broken make Summer laugh. Fast forward to later in the 500-day timeline and those exact same jokes are met with silence.Tom is the focal point of the movie, and it's easy to sympathise him. Not only does he look like a 'normal' person (as opposed to the usual six foot tall and ridiculously handsome rom-com male lead), but we can see his pain as he starts out believing he's no chance with Summer, to falling in love with her and slowly realising that she doesn't love him in the same way. This is something most 'average' men can relate to: falling for a woman who seems too good for them, only to painfully discover they don't feel the same way, regardless of how much they seem to care. While the film can be depressing at times (especially when Tom seems to be given a second chance with Summer only to discover she's engaged), it does end on a hopeful note for Tom. The pain he went through with Summer forces him to re-evaluate his life and pursue his true love of architecture, which also leads to a possible new love interest.There's a real chemistry between Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt and the relationship is believable. Deschanel plays to her ""manic pixie dream girl"" strengths and, as always, comes off as charming and adorable. Gordon-Levitt portrays all the insecurities and foibles of the ""average"" man while still coming off as likable.While the film is about a failed relationship, the underlining message seems to be about personal growth. While Tom and Summer were never meant to be, both characters grow because of the relationship and start improving their lives. It shows that, despite the short-term pain, a failed relationship isn't the end of the world, but an opportunity to learn and grow for the next one.

It does little to embody the true nature of this film, which, is far greater than what can be said in a few words.Rather loosely do I consider this film a ""Rom Com."" By comparison to others, yes -- you may call it ""off-beat."" However, in ways that mere words will do little to express, I found it incredibly ON-beat. If your heart beats at all like Tom Hansen's, you will be in awe at how perfectly this film mirrors and embodies your deepest experiences with girls like Summer Finn. In this way, the story is amazingly realistic, and the connection that is carefully crafted between viewer and movie is absolutely profound. It reaches out to you blindly, KNOWING it will grab your hand.The scenes between Tom and Summer are virtually perfect. Perfect in the sense that they form the core essence of the film which is based on a true story -- that story being your life. In this way, I consider the movie non-fiction. Everything about it is so archetypal. The experiences, the characters. Summer Finn is the EPITOME of those her type, and if you can relate to this film as much as I can, you will INEVITABLY think of certain girls from your past. Even more profoundly, certain scenes may trigger flashbacks of your past -- it's THAT relatable.By comparison with it's artistically liberal nature, its cinematic approach is a bit uncomplicated and perhaps at times slightly sub-par. On one hand, I consider it a very realistic movie and in that way, less is more. On the other however, I feel the camera work and editing could have been a bit more interesting. There were some sweet spots here and there, likely inspired by the French New Wave approach of ""The Graduate,"" but ultimately the cinematography had a lot more potential to lend itself to the emotion of the movie.All in all, this is a phenomenal film. It plays in an odd time signature, experimenting with key, scale, and tempo changes, but again: If you're like me or Tom Hansen, you know that it plays to the beat of a broken heart, and that's beautiful.

(2) the anger and frustration when it's clear that there is an emotional disconnect between the characters; Tom again - perfect. (3) The pain of withdrawal and slow recovery - make no mistake, this is love addiction where a character goes cold turkey. It's tough to watch.I don't know if women relate to this movie in the same way, but this is a movie that is A Good Guy's perspective on finding and losing love without ever really knowing the woman whom he loves and why it doesn't work. As such, Zooey's Summer is an appropriately opaque character. Her feelings, motives intentions, etc., are all below the surface; there are just those amazingly melting eyes. You could argue that her character could be more fully developed, but realistically, I think her character allows Tom to see all that Guys are able to see. Summer and Tom make a good argument for women and men being different species that happen to be genetically capable of reproducing. They are not Mars and Venus; they are more like Mercury and Pluto. Even at their final accidental meeting, Tom is no closer to understanding Summer than he was when he first met her, and it's still not clear how she feels about anything. Zooey's character has a secret heart that is just unknowable to Tom, to the viewer; maybe to Summer as well.The disjointed, non-linear structure of the movie make the pain easier to tolerate; just a little at a time. It feels like the way you remember a relationship. So 10 stars for a wonderful and unusual movie. For guys, I think, it's also a True story. That's worth everything.

(500) Days of Summer,44,Colin George,06/Apr/10,6,9.096178336690555e-10,film movie not story comedy funny even films way much love make makes may work performances enough still new never two see old cast without people something real human character year romantic worth better hollywood isnt dont moments,0.75,4.0,inf,inf,inf," The trailer for Marc Webb's ""500 Days of Summer"" goes out of its way to define itself as especially ""not a love story,"" which I guess is arguable by some gimmicky perspective technicality, and the film and its creators clearly imagine themselves pioneers in the romcom genre, but are deluding themselves if they don't admit to their playful plagiarism of half a dozen better films.It's not that ""Summer"" is an entirely derivative work, but when a film is touted for its imagination, call me old-fashioned, but I'd like to see something new. The story and performances are satisfying, but its impossible to hear the staccato, high-brow, third-person narration without being reminded of Wes Anderson's ""Royal Tenenbaums,"" or ignore the similarities to Michel Gondry's ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" in its non-linear examination of a crumbling relationship, or even watch the film's exuberant park dance sequence without being distracted by its striking resemblance to a number in Disney's ""Enchanted.""The film relies on a few other pet peeve clich Ãs, like a precocious eleven year old (Chloe Moretz) who coaches her grown-up brother, Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), through his rocky relationship with Summer (Zooey Deschanel), or the ending. There's unquestionably more emotional maturity on display in Webb's film than in most PG-13 Hollywood romantic comedies, but its final moments are pure formula. It's not that Tom and Summer are able to reconcile; they aren't. The trailer said as much. But the popular, ludicrously sentimental and instantly unnecessary rule in ending a romantic comedy in which the love interests don't reunite is that the protagonist needs to meet someone else by the film's end, almost always tacked onto the last five minutes. And as if that wasn't sappy enough, Tom's new girl is eye- rollingly named 'Autumn.' Come on, movie. You were talking about real people there for a minute.But as I said, the film is halfway able to overcome its foundation of clich Ãs mostly thanks to the stellar performances of its cast. Zooey Deschanel is adorable and completely believable as the sort of siren that would drive a guy like Tom out of his mind. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is charming and funny and never comes off as pathetic as the character easily could. The supporting cast, particularly Geoffrey Arend as Tom's buddy McKenzie, is spot on.Still, ""Summer"" is atonal, perhaps from inception in its intention to create both visual metaphors for the sublimity of love and the unapologetic reality of loneliness, but the two worlds never cooperate for the artistic whole, effective as they may be apart. The occasional superfluous bit of narration, precedent-setting but decidedly uncommon fantasy sequences, textbook indie quirk, and non-sequential storytelling all ultimately distract from what would otherwise be considered an acceptable but utterly average love story. And let's face it. To suggest ""500 Days of Summer"" isn't a love story makes for a nice piece of sloganeering, but is as gimmicky and wafer-thin as the methods Webb employs to distinguish his film from the rest of the romcom crowd. It's a sweet, human piece of storytelling undone by its faux- ingenuity. Everything that distinguishes ""500 Days of Summer"" has been done better before, and while it's still worth a few healthy chuckles, the young filmmakers hardly make a name for themselves beyond copycats.

At its best, it can be either sweet and insightful or downright heartbreaking. Too bad its best comes around only rarely. Most of the film is made up of wannabe clever moments that make it come off as overly cutesy. Among the aspects the film should have dumped to the wayside: the precocious little sister, the completely useless and unfunny best friends, the constant references to indie music and attempts to win indie cred, the Hall & Oates musical number (an ironic wink to the same people who will swoon over the rest of the soundtrack), the quirky greeting card company and, probably most notably, the final sequence. After excising all that, the film would only run about 45 minutes. About the only bit of cleverness that works is a split scene sequence where, the first time Gordon-Levitt is meeting with Deschanel after their big break-up, his expectations play out in real time against what actually happens. That could have backfired, as so much of the rest of the film does, but Webb directs it so well that the end result is devastating. This happens near the end of the film, and for a while it felt like it was jettisoning cutesiness for real emotion. And then comes the final sequence, which is the worst in recent memory. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has given three of the greatest performances of the current decade in Mysterious Skin, Brick and The Lookout. His character here isn't especially well written, and I think he tries to overcompensate a little. Deschanel, playing the title character, is fairly two dimensional. Webb clearly based the girl on a real ex-girlfriend, and it would have been nice to have this film feel more personal.

The film for one, is not in chronological order, and has some creative twists to it, (examples include a expectation vs. reality sequence and a random dance number to express the characters mood.. now usually i hate dancing in movies, but this was just awesome because it was not taken seriously, we know that it's not really reality, but it somehow fits right in.) The relationships between the two main characters, and also the relationships between other characters seemed realistic and every character was likable... except maybe Summer at some parts. The film also stars Joseph Gordon Levitt who I am now a fan of and since seeing the movie, look out for his others.

After enduring February's He's Just Not That Into You, I really started to believe that the future for this particular genre, in terms of any sort of artistic appeal or entries that have any weight to them at all, was dismal. There have been some notable offerings over the last year or so in the form of some energetic indie films, but nothing to write home about.But then comes along first-time director Marc Webb with an enjoyable little number that has, at least for the time being, restored my faith in the rom-com. Remember the bliss that was Garden State? Think of (500) Days of Summer as a slightly more mature, infinitely more whimsical relative of the 2004 Zach Braff hit.The story follows the exploits of Tom Hansen, a twenty-something who grew up with rock-solid faith in the promise that there is such a thing as true love and that it's waiting for that perfect moment to manifest itself in our lives. He works as a writer for a greeting card company: you know, the ones that turn out the same ""Hang in there!"" drivel you often find at your local Hallmark. Things are mediocre as usual until the day Tom's boss hires Summer Finn as an assistant. Tom is instantly mesmerized by her, and does all he can to catch her attention.The cat and mouse game that results is well crafted, funny, and true to life. Though things start to tire slightly at the conclusion, witnessing the evolution of the relationship between Tom and Summer is a real treat, and it shows that screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber have a real eye for the nuanced interactions that comprise the modern relationship for many people. The whole thing is intermittently narrated (literally and figuratively) too, which helps provide a decidedly ""fairy tale""-esque panache that both delivers on the promises we're fed during childhood and dashes them by deftly exploring the not- so-pretty harshness of how relationships often play out in the real world. All of this is nicely underscored by the fact that both Tom and Summer's parents are divorced__a key point that plays into their own expectations regarding relationships (particularly Summer's). This is made especially clear in a scene during which Tom and Summer purposely become lost in the maze that comprises their local Ikea. The pair jokingly takes on the stereotypical roles expected of a man and wife, with Summer cheerfully removing imaginary food from an oven and Tom sitting at a spotless kitchen table. He beams with an over-the-top smile, feigning pride in regards to the ""mock life"" that him and his partner have fostered. There's some real subtextual resonance here, and it shows that everyone involved in (500) Days of Summer really wanted to create a film that goes beyond mere entertainment__they wanted to make something that their audience can relate to.There's also an artistic flair to the movie that makes it that much more interesting. Though it's rather infrequent, scenes sometimes transition into rough sketches mimicking those that Tom, who was schooled in architecture (though he chose not to pursue it as a career), pens in his notepad during his afternoon musings in a downtown Los Angeles park. The film even includes some cartoon animation, which shows Webb's ability to work some perfectly appropriate, albeit cheesy humor into the production. There are one or two instances where it seems as if (500) Days of Summer is ""being indie"" just for the sake of being indie, but these are few and far between. They're also instantly forgivable in the midst of the accomplishments the film manages, especially considering the unrealistic convention that so many recent romantic comedies have fallen victim to.If you want an enjoyable night at the movies with your significant other, then go check out (500) Days of Summer. It's entertaining and thoughtful, a combination that's extraordinarily rare in the rom-coms I've encountered thus far in 2009.

The premise is extraordinary, and profound, however quite mature. The film focuses on a couple whose relationship is solely dedicated to intercourse, but end up having few moments of true unadulterated love. This is not to say that the film was a sex comedy, or for that matter a comedy. It was more of a drama, and it is quite sad in some parts, but none the less it is an amazing film. The acting is, as expected, superb. The script was very well written, and the film flowed very naturally and smooth. The points that it makes about love, and relationships are interesting and very original. The film is very psychological, and impressively toys with your emotions in a good way.

What could go wrong? A lot, it turns out, when one person's notion of a love to last a lifetime clashes with another's idea of the same situation as a like that will last a lunchtime.Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a trained architect who has spent his last three-plus years awash in sentimentality, writing greeting cards as he pretends to be satisfied with his life. Enter Summer (Zooey Deschanel), a beautiful receptionist who takes an interest in him, one that blossoms when they discover a passion for some of the same things, like karaoke and theme music from the TV show ""Knight Rider.""As much a launching pad for a thousand debates as a twisted take on romantic comedy conventions, ""(500) Days Of Summer"" raises a question it never quite gets around to answering about the nature of true love. Still, its ambling quality offers up much pleasure.So does Deschanel, working her usual magic to less gentle affect than normal. It's impossible to dislike her, with her killer blues or the way her nose crinkles when she laughs. But you can't help feeling frustrated by her, a frustration that the film builds upon by presenting their relationship in a series of non-chronological episodes. Tom the frustrated architect is trying to make reality of his fantasy, but Summer isn't really going along. It's here that the film rubs against familiar romantic comedy conventions and carves out some unique emotional territory.""I need to know you aren't going to wake up in the morning and feel differently,"" he tells her.""I can't give you that,"" she replies. ""No one can."" Especially not her, though.In addition to the two leads, the film is strengthened by the supporting cast, especially Tom's two buddies, loyal office wingman MacKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) and the more wistful, happily married Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler). Together they provide a hip Greek chorus to Tom's troubles.Gordon-Levitt is a fine, charismatic center for the film. He's part Ahab and part Cary Grant here, getting into a bar fight one moment, the next trying to cover his embarrassment when Summer challenges him to yell the word ""penis"" in a public park as loud as he can. The more he reaches, the more ground he loses, but I think even female viewers will empathize with his concerns. It's funny that the actor himself has said he thinks his character doesn't merit the rooting interest; he may be the only person who thinks that after seeing the movie.The issue here is not one of gender differences, but different takes on life. I go back to him as a frustrated architect, trying to make the rules he understands work in a situation that doesn't allow for them. She's not one to be tied down by anyone else's plans.I realize I'm taking the same approach many others take in regard to this film, by focusing on the dramatic issues and ignoring the comedy. It's pretty funny in places, and well-observed, like when he agonizes over how she answers a simple question about how her weekend was. I love one scene early on when he meets her at a company function, and she tells him she had heard he wasn't showing up. ""You asked?"" he blurts out, beaming triumphantly.The more elaborate comedy sequences don't always come off so well, especially when they become street dancing scenes or parodies of Swedish cinema. These are funny moments, but they don't connect to the main story and become distracting. Worst of all is a rather pat ending, though even that works well enough to let you out with a smile.What really makes ""(500) Days Of Summer"" work is the bracing way director Marc Webb and writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber raise questions about the nature of love. They don't do as good a job of answering them, but do leave you thinking, success of a kind most rom-coms never attain.

I knew this beforehand but still thought it would be a good date movie, so I asked a hot chick to watch it with me. Why am I telling you this? Mostly because I wanted to brag about finally working up the nerve to ask out a hot chick. But also to let you know that ""(500) Days of Summer"" isn't exactly a hot date movie.So much better, it's a very clever story about perception and particularly how emotions affect perception. In 1950 Kurosawa gave us the legendary film ""Rash Â´mon"" which defined the technique by using multiple narrators to tell the story of a murder. A few years ago, the French film ""He Loves Me... He Loves Me Not"" took the same basic idea and applied it to a love story. Here we have yet another innovation. It's a lovestory highlighting different perspectives, but they're coming from the same person.How did the director accomplish this? By jumping around the timeline. ""(500) Days of Summer"" begins at Day #488, then back to Day #1, then forward, then back, etc. It can be slightly disorienting at times, but I believe that is the intent. By departing from the standard linear storytelling, the director accentuates the bipolar jumps in perception experienced by a guy who's alternately in & out of love.I don't know if this has been done before (several people have compared this film to ""Annie Hall"" which I haven't seen), but for me it was a thoroughly original experience.The acting is great. Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers yet another charming performance as the handsome nerd who's desperately trying to get a grip. Zooey Deschanel plays a challenging role: one minute lovable, the next minute not-so-lovable (in keeping with the theme of the film), and she truly delivers. You just have to see the movie to know what I'm talking about.If you liked ""Rash Â´mon"" or ""He Loves Me..."" you should definitely check this out & see what you think. I'd also compare it to another great offbeat romcom ""Adam"" and a really offbeat French romcom(?) called ""The Girl from Monaco"".""(500) Days of Summer"" has spots of comedy & a light-hearted presentation, although its primary focus is the drama & the underlying theme of ""reality vs. expectation"". Again, not the perfect date movie. Although we both liked it, I don't know if I'll get a 2nd date with the hot girl... quick can someone suggest a good Hugh Grant flick?

Young people can fall head over heel for a perfect stranger. Probably it is the hormones and lack of experience coupled with expectations too high. Of course, falling for someone does not guarantee your love will be reciprocated. This is what happens to Tom, a romantic boy, slightly disconnected from reality, who thinks he met the ""one"" only to find out she was not. The ""wrong"" girl is Summer who - allegedly - does not believe in love, but in practice might be just looking for Mr Right.The story is told in non-linear fashion, which for once enhances the quirky narrative. However, we can easily reconstruct the story, from the day they met - Tom filled with romantic and naive expectations, Summer disconnected from her feelings. When Tom and Summer get together, she feels ""happy"" and finds him ""funny"", but he is convinced she is Ms Right (no explanation is given about the reason of Tom's obsession that Summer is the ""one"").Things fall apart quite abruptly, when Summer gets in a bad mood and dumps Tom after having watched ""The Graduate"" together. Summer seems a selfish, immature girl who has no clue about what she wants. She lies to herself and to others. Rather than intentionally evil, she just seems frivolous and uncaring, pursuing her own happiness and disregarding whoever does not satisfy criteria she cannot even define.Tom seems to be a naive victim of literature and music about romantic love. The concept of the ""one"" seems to be a torture device for American audiences, who need to be constantly reassured that such a person actually exists. Unfortunate, romantic concepts are purely fictional. Long-lasting relationships are based on more solid ground than physical attraction and common interests (""We both like Magritte and Hopper"" gushes Tom enthusiastically, as if this is further proof that Summer is his twin soul__).This comedy deals with emotional matters so important for the young in the most charming way and the script, editing and soundtrack are absolutely brilliant.

He is the unrequited love interest in the film. JGL does have brief glimpses of true love with Summer (Zooey Deschanel) but it's clear she's not interested in anything permanent, just a good time.

That is the warning given to the viewer at the beginning of the movie. And it certainly meets the assumption as we wander deeper and deeper into the complicated relationship of Tom and Summer. He is an idealistic dreamer, who think that in order to achieve happiness he has to fall in love with the one, perfect girl. She happens to be his exact contrary female version - she doesn't believe in happy endings and fairy tales. So how exactly do these two very different people end up being a couple for the eponymous 500 days? For all the lovebirds out there, this could mean that sometimes the exception proves the rule! However, I have to blunt right now - sadly, as the viewer is about to find out, the differences and arising conflicts can only produce a disastrous result and drive two people apart.There are many reasons why I simply fell in love with this picture: it is not a typical movie, due to the fact that it connects some aspects of a typical romance with various features of a down- to-earth drama. This process is best shown through the intersection of parts that show everything in bright and positive colors, with the sun shining and the birds singing, and parts that include rainstorms, dark humor, sad faces and deeply philosophical sentences. This cinematic procedure really invites to get a broader look at this very particular relationship, which can sometimes seem as a smooth and joyful one. And then, just a few seconds later, it provides a scene that changes the perspective 180 degree around.Great performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. You could certainly see that they had so much fun playing the main parts. What is more, because of the fact that the connection between the two stars carries the whole plot in an amazing fashion, the recognition that they deserve for their wonderful acting should be even bigger.Personally, I am not a big fan of romantic movies, that is why I didn't know what to expect when I started watching (500) Days of Summer. But in the end I was astonished. It provides a new light onto this genre and changes the way we might perceive it. It stand out from the crowd of all those, mostly boring, standard romances and shows that in real life not everybody ends up living happily ever after - sometimes we have to put up a hell of a fight to get closer to a person we admire.

But then it starts to crack: the regard is not enough to match the admiration he feels, and he'll never get to her bare bones. They'll have to part.

With the exception being Summer's honestly, and Tom's vanity (once she knows me her mind will change). Tom never does anything wrong, like a lot of us, however he lacks that wow factor and by being more into her than she is to him the pain he feels we feel like is our own because he deserves more than he is getting (emotionally at least). Wanting someone and them wanting you is different than wanting someone and them putting up with you, which so frequently happens.

But in contrast to the heavy handed, conventional, and leaden quality of most romantic comedies that inhabit the multiplex, it almost feels like a miracle. Amidst all the pop-culture glitter that surrounds the film, the protagonists ask some fairly profound questions about the nature of love and fate. It's so refreshing to see a filmmaker acknowledge that these aren't concepts that are set in stone; that most relationships don't automatically begin with a contrived meet-cute and end with a wedding. The process of love is detailed here, and the tragedy of building your love and hopes on a totally misguided foundation is rendered movingly. Tom is a person whose passions are directed at the wrong targets; clearly Summer is not in the same place he is and never will be. He is a greeting card writer, a profession trafficking in the most trite and simple emotions, instead of following his passion for architecture. Meanwhile Summer is also floating; her character is never developed and remains sketchy, but I think that this is intentional by the writers. Summer's feet never really touch the ground until she does what she thought was impossible - fall in love. From the perspective of Tom, which is really the character that we are supposed to sympathize with, Summer remains a cloudy object of desire, forever eluding definition. He never REALLY gets her, which is why they could never be together. Both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel do a terrific job of interpreting the characters as they were written. They truly make you care about these people and wonder what they are doing when the movie ends. Some of the inserts and segments may be a little gimmicky, but the picture overall is really memorable. The music and cinematography are gorgeous and deserve recognition.

Well, you know, I hate the genre in general, so I guess any film which has something more to it than just a happy love story with a wedding between the main characters in the end would make it in my top romance films. First with the problems. There are some clich Ãs in this film (the smart little sister, the righteous guy who transforms and sets to follow his true vocation, fight in the bar for a girl etc.), sometimes the situations seem unnatural (the drunken singing, fight in the bar, the somewhat strange boss and coworkers). Now the good things. One of the first things you notice is the wonderful indie soundtrack. It really sets a nice mood on the film and is fun to listen. I really liked some of the decisions the director made. The ""expectations vs reality"" scene is wonderful, the city fading to a drawing which is then erased is also nice, the IKEA scene is also very lovable, although I can't get over the feeling this idea has already been somewhere. But I liked the most the moral of the story. I myself have had my Summer, and now I am so happy with my Autumn. With the first girl, there was so much expectations from my side that I was terribly upset when it went wrong. I then of course met another girl and this time after 3 years we are still happy with each other and it looks she might just be the one. Both my relationships happened by accident. So I have also come to realise that although I love my girl so much at the moment, I would have found another and fallen in love with her instead if not that accident. That love is not something fate determines, but what you make of the series of relationships by the method of trial and error, finding the person who is really good for you.To all who argue this film has a happy ending which spoils the film. Where is it said that they lived happily ever after? It's just a new relationship, a new page which could be anything. Which could be whatever the persons make of it. They could say bye to each other after that cup of coffee, or they could marry and have kids eventually. This is just a reminder that there's always a next chance after your heart is broken.

Year after year, we get the same old tired formula, only in different ways, and while I do enjoy some of them, they do get tiring after a while, because it's so utterly predictable. Here I couldn't predict a thing, even when I thought I could. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel make one of the most intriguing and original couples in sometime, showing us how relationships are not fairy tales like the movies make it out to be, and how tough it really is. I also liked how almost every day passed, a screen would show up saying what day it was at, I thought that was a unique addition.SPOILER: If you don't wanna know, please don't read any further.500 Days also has to be quite possibly, the only original romantic comedy, that doesn't have your typical happy ending. Tom and Summer don't get together. Tom's hard work does NOT pay off, and Summer ends up getting married, which I didn't expect. 500 Days of Summer tries to show us there are no fairy tales, or miracles, but by showing Tom meeting another woman at a meeting at the end of the film, it also shows things aren't totally disastrous.Performances. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is turning out to be one of the great up and coming actors, proving there is hope for the new generation. Here he is convincingly in love, and I could relate to him 100%. It also helps that his heart is pure, and he has a unique sense of humor. Zooey Deschanel is charming, and really good, but if I have a mild complaint, it's her character was very cold and manipulative sometimes. Geoffrey Arend is very funny as Tom's best friend McKenzie. He was goofy, but likable.Bottom line. (500) Days Of Summer is now one of my favorite Rom com's. It's original, it's funny, it's downbeat, and I can't find many bad things to say about it. It really opened up my eyes for relationships, and it shows not every romance is a fairytale waiting to happen, not matter how deep the love is.

(500) Days of Summer,86,michaelhennessy8,17/Feb/10,8,2.7515277101999523e-08,film movie one not will films love make just makes work director little new never two see performance entertaining ever big tale often doesnt character feel romantic take audience right music moments might,1.0,1.0,inf,inf,inf," Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is an unashamed romantic, yet feels unfulfilled churning out simple sentiments as a writer for a greeting card firm. One day, new co-worker Summer (Zooey Deschanel) overhears him listening to The Smiths, a band whom they share a passion for. Summer likes Tom. Tom loves Summer. Summer will never love Tom.What makes this tale of unrequited love so interesting is its telling. The five hundred days of the title refer to the time-span of Tom's feelings for Summer, beginning before and continuing after their affair. The screenplay hops back and forth between various 'days', creating a clever little puzzle of the build-up and breakdown of a relationship. On 'Day 282', for example, Tom refers to a cutesy in-joke he shared with Summer at the height of their romance; she responds impassively. The scene promptly jumps back to 'Day 34' and the birth of this joke, a moment as intimate as they'd ever share. It's an interesting structural ploy, and the various contrasts and ambiguities it brings to the fore reflect Tom's post-break-up obsessive poring over his days with Summer.Director Marc Webb does a fine job of keeping such an erratic structure feeling smooth, adeptly conveying exhilaration and heartache, often within a single scene. His credentials as a former music video director are evident; the film is stylistic, if not quite stylish, as Webb employs a plethora of slick visual tricks to convey the headiness and confusion of romance.Gordon-Levitt adds a more lightweight lead to his roster of rogues. Tom is likable, if not charismatic; injured, rather than damaged. Like the film, his performance is well-pitched and endearing, but in no danger of topping his staggering work in Brick and Mysterious Skin. He invests Tom with just the right amount of vulnerability; his very slight awkwardness leavens rather than encumbers the screenplay's deconstruction of neurosis. He makes for a refreshingly believable romantic lead in the nerdy wish-fulfilment era of Cera.Deschanel is similarly well-cast. She surveys everything with a detached demeanour that is at odds with her big bright eyes. The blending of her lovely features with her disaffected drawl is a potent mix, and makes Summer a devastating force for the men around her. Inverting her typecast role, it's nice to see Deschanel offering us a glimpse of the void beneath the (vaguely irritating) quirky surface.While the synopsis might suggest an anti-romance movie- the film itself opens with such a claim- the bitterness, like the titular time-span, is bracketed. The film is ultimately hopeful, always entertaining and frequently funny.But like every melancholic Smiths fan, one can't help but feel the urge to take it down a peg or two. The intermittent use of an unnamed narrator is jarring and superfluous, while the indie soundtrack is relentless, pervading almost every scene. 'Just because someone shares your interests, doesn't make them your soul-mate', Tom's wise-beyond-her-years younger sister intones (a cloying clich Ã of a character, admittedly, but her scenes make for some of the film's funniest moments). The filmmakers should take this advice, and resist the need to define their film and connect with their audience with the aid of a mix-tape.Aside from these criticisms, the movie hits all the right notes- and what higher praise could be given of a romantic-comedy, the genre of comfort? It evokes effectively the turbulence of love through an engaging structure, and is anchored by another fine performance from Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

Immediately you can tell that the film incorporates innovative techniques towards it's narrative structure, as the story is continuously told through the past, present and future shown through the time span of 500 hundred days.Eventually we learn that tom met summer through her gaining a job at the same workplace, a card factory. Furthermore we learn that tom is quite good at his job which represent his thoughts on love being contributed from the concepts of pop-culture, for instance the ideas of faith and 'soul mates', while quite differently summer thoughts on love are based in a more realistic sense than rather influenced from clich Ãd ideas.By using these characters to represent the different concepts of 'love', Webb creates a brilliant comparison between the realistic and idealistic view of 'love'. Webb captures this brilliantly, especially in one scene where tom is walking to summer's house party after they break up, hoping that this event will rejuvenate their love. While tom is walking to summer's the screen is split into two, reality and expectations. This juxtapositions is brilliant because Webb captures a moment shared among many, the hoping that the women you love will come back to you but eventually reality wins. These techniques used evoke the audacious of woody Allen narrative techniques.There is also two brilliant uses of homages to the graduate and Ingmar Bergman, not just a gimmick but rather a another way of representing the characters emotions. tom and summer are at the theaters watching the graduate and by the ending summer begins to cry, as the ending of the graduate portrayed the characters accessing their values on their relationship and realizing if they truly loved each other, summer cries because she shares the same feelings. The other homage is to the great Ingmar Bergman, tom is at the theater after he has separated from summer, and three sequences from Bergman movies play, representing tom deep depressions.The end of the movie was brilliant in capturing the essence of love, quite evident in tom and summer's final conversation highlighting the evasiveness of love and it's unpredictably motives.Finally a movie the depicts love in a realistic process (and funny), despite how off-beat it may seem.

When I mean the wrong type of fantastical, I mean that it is an unrealistic play-through of how real life events could, in reality, occur, though only through astronomical coincidence. For example, bumping into the girl you love after you've broken up in the place you used to feed the ducks, and then doing some extreme romantic gesture, like dancing on a rooftop, to win her back etc. That doesn't click with me, because these romantic films are set in our world, our reality. The rules are established from the principal contact - this will not feature any space-monkeys, will be entirely within our realm of physics and as a result, I can't take such implausible coincidences. We enjoy films like the Inception, The Lord of the Rings, because they take place in a world where the rules are established to beyond our capacity to understand in reality. And in that fantasy, anything can happen and suspension of disbelief does the rest. But in our world, things like that don't happen - we've all been in relationships so we know for a fact, film romance is not ever applicable, and as a result, we don't learn anything, we don't grow by travelling these characters, we're just killing time. Although you might call me stupid, saying films would be boring if they only remained within our mundane reality, I say this when taking into account the tired clich Ã love formula, that pretty much stays the same no matter what route you take or what spin you put on it. We know that everything will be all right in the end and the characters will kiss on a bridge with candlelight and the beautiful lit sky. Not in this film.The film in question takes the tired formula and breaks it over its knee with some of the most inventive story-telling and camera work I've ever seen - and this is technically an independent film. The acting is superb throughout - the two leads Joseph Gorden-Levitt and Zoe Deshcanel are spectacular and their chemistry is contagious. These are not actors - these are real people. We love these people and we want to see their relationship develop.Another rare thing for a Rom-com - it's funny. I can sit through the majority of crap with Hugh Grant and maybe chuckle a few times, this gets you laughing from the get go and then becomes serious at the appropriate moments. This is another film that I call a 'moment picture'. A film that contains these small sections in little moments that are either a stroke of genius, a powerful emotional impact, or something that just makes you euphoric watching, regardless of overall quality. These moments are memorable, and they are the parts you talk about after you've seen it. You can watch any number of films that contain no moments at all or maybe one or two - this is full of them. Combined with excellent pacing and consistent engaging content it makes this film, to me, flawless. The only reason I don't give it a 10, is because although perfect, It's not quite up there with the other films I've rated 10, but that is by no means a detriment to this film.In short, watch it.

(500) Days of Summer,89,moviemanMA,27/Jul/09,10,5.336786664908653e-10,film one not story well films time can way life much love make just enough fun new great two only first people ever something tale audience worth really screen right,0.666666667,3.0,inf,inf,inf," Love. One of most confusing words in the English language. A person can love another person, a sandwich, a car, a feeling, and a host of other things, people, and places. Love. Just four letters that mean so much.In Marc Webb's directorial debut (500) Days of Summer, we find out exactly what love is. A while ago I saw the trailer for this film and it came with a warning: ""This is not a love story. This is a story about love."" This could not have been a truer statement.Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Tom Hansen. He is currently employed at a greeting cards company in Los Angeles but dreams of making it as an architect, someday. His life is rather ordinary until he meets his boss' new secretary, Summer Finn, played by Zooey Deschanel. After their first encounter, Summer is the only thing that Tom can think of. He knows that this is the girl, this is ""the one"". Tom believes that love is out there waiting for him. Summer on the other hand feels the opposite, that true love belongs in songs and fairy tales. What happens when these two ideals collide?The resulting relationship the two embark on is unlike any other put on celluloid. It's a beautiful, tragic, comic, musical, whimsical tale of love, heartache, and life lessons. Each era of film has ""the couple"" that reflect the ideals and mannerisms of the time. There was Roman Holiday, The Graduate, When Harry Met Sally, Singles, and up until now, Garden State. Here comes the next generation of lovers. This film shows the intimate details of a modern day romance from dating to the bedroom.There is so much I want to say but can't because it would spoil not just the story but the fun. Webb employs some unique storytelling techniques. Each scene offers something new both stylistically as well as changing the direction of the film ever so slightly. Along the way we bounce back and forth in Tom and Summer's relationship showing the highs and lows and everything in between.Webb's unique style appears to be influenced by several other directors. There are a few homages to other films and movements, something I enjoyed immensely. I sensed that Goddard, Fellini, Minnelli, and a few others were inspiration for certain scenes.One thing Webb does right is use his actors correctly. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are magical on screen together. They make each scene worth while with their delivery and on screen presence. No lines are wasted, no looks go unnoticed. They nail the mood and purpose of the film.I cannot stress enough how amazing and important the soundtrack is in this film. Like The Graduate or Garden State, we have a great selection of songs, each serving both an entertainment and story telling purpose. Songs from artists like The Smiths, Regina Spektor, The Temper Trap, and Hall & Oates give the film a way to communicate with the audience on more than one level.I can't stress enough how amazing (500) Days of Summer really is. It's a new twist on a tired genre of indie romance films. It has everything you could possibly want from a film. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end. It's a remarkable achievement, especially for such a small production. Bravo Mr. Webb. I greatly anticipate your next film. "," Love.

(500) Days of Summer,90,secondtake,23/Oct/09,7,5.3010357755936004e-12,film movie one not story good even way much love make just movies little enough still fun two first also without something humor often doesnt sense character year man get really screen isnt dont moments might plot,0.6,5.0,inf,inf,inf," 500 Days of Summer (2009)OK. First--I liked this movie. I seem to emphasize reasons why it wasn't terrific below, but it's good to remember I liked it. And didn't love it.Maybe the clever beginning, insisting through a deep-voiced narrator with a twitch of humor, raises expectations a little: this is not a love story. But it looks and feels like one, and of course, it is one, whatever the end might imply. Love varies and is still love.The movie leans on its format, jumping from moment to moment back and forth through the year and a half of the movie, to give it some of its verve. Surprises are often created by a wry coupling of moments--a happy person as the elevator doors close turns to a sad person when they open, a couple hundred days later. And then back, to day 3 or day 40, or whatever gap might be mined for laughs and irony. This saves the movie, really, but it also becomes the movie, instead of the relationship between the two young leads. The relationship should be everything, and it is everything, of course, but it isn't really much. If you put the pieces back in chronological order, you have something not too amazing, something actually pretty dull, certainly not an hour and half's worth.The man, Tom, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the woman, Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel, are almost perfect. They're fun, they are witty, they are restrained as needed, they show tenderness. I liked them a lot, but I didn't love them, and neither did the person I saw the movie with. And if there is a film that needs a couple with magic on the screen, true chemistry, this is it. But then, of course, the ending might make sense in this light. But then, further, if the whole point is a movie about a romance that doesn't quite get off the ground, it keeps the movie grounded, too. I prefer a movie that takes off somehow.Except for some movie oddities, the events are told simply, and out of order. There is the dancing in the park (completely out of character, but I liked it because it was a breath of air, fresh or not, just air), and some split screen comparisons (sometimes just a way of layering the plot, sometimes to create plot, by creating a fantasy on one side and reality on the other). And these are good, even if they remind you that a lot of the rest is just plain vanilla. In all, the movie is fun, for sure, a joy even, and without glaring issues. Certain clich Ãs are avoided--the woman is strong and smart, the man gentle and un-macho. They actually make a nice couple. But maybe slightly less interesting than some of your friends, who they don't make movies about for the simple reason they aren't interesting enough. "," 500 Days  Summer (2009)OK.

(500) Days of Summer,91,Marmaduke90,05/Oct/09,6,3.924946325956691e-14,film one not good comedy funny even films can way life much love just may little still new never great two only see first made also though people something real sense character romantic picture man full really screen music dont moments,0.6,5.0,inf,inf,inf," A young man named Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who designs greeting cards falls in love with Summer (Zooey Deschanel) a new woman working in his office. Their relationship, including the breakup, is told in a non-linear fashion with a counter appearing on screen to show what particular days in their relationship we are viewing. At first Summer seems to only want to be friends but then still quickly changes her mind commences a relationship with Tom. They regularly toy with question of whether they are friends or whether they are actually a couple. Gradually, we see the way in which their relationship has worn down Tom and contributed to his bitterness, his attempt to win her back and his eventual realisation on love.This offbeat comedy, released by Fox Searchlight Pictures, the same distributor as Juno, echoes Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in the way that it plays with structure in showing the breakdown of a relationship. This is the first film of Marc Webb, who previously worked with music videos. Through its voice over, alternative soundtrack and visual flair like split screens and sketch drawings, the film is high self-conscious about itself as a 'post-Juno' indie film, while also mimicking the likes of Garden State too. Rather than grounding the film entirely in a sense of realism like Juno though, the film jarringly tries to combine a realistic depiction of a relationship with more exaggerated moments. A prologue detailing how Summer's presence alone was able to raise the revenue of an ice-cream parlour, or a conversation in the bed of an IKEA store about how Summer is not looking for an entirely serious relationship, seem particularly unfitting. With a greater sense of restraint and deeper insights, this would have been a more emotionally rewarding film.Given its non-linear structure, it is surprising how simple the majority of the film is in its representation of a failed relationship. Two of the most visually elaborate moments of the picture highlight this simplicity. After Tom sleeps with Summer, he awakes the next morning full of swagger and begins dancing with people in the street, as an animated bird and a marching band appear on screen. Though funny, this sequence is never used as a platform to extend upon what the relationship is providing for Tom beyond the current happiness we are seeing. Late in the film when Tom has split with Summer, he still attends her party and the film divides itself into a split screen showing how the party briefly plays out on both what he expected to happen and what the reality is. Though again this is a visually clever idea, it plays to the most basic of emotions on screen, adding little depth or discussion to the failure of the relationship itself. Similarly, sex throughout the film is either highly trivialised or shied away from entirely. Although in one scene Tom and Summer watch a pornographic film together and then try to mimic the same shower sex, there is little attempt to examine tougher issues, like the way that sex is used to sustain even the most unlikely relationships. Only by the end of the film do the most intellectual points, like a discussion of whether relationships come from fate or are coincidental, begin to surface.Despite a certainly air of smugness about much of the film's humour, the occasional echo of real life is actually very funny to see on screen: a moment where Tom and his friends examine the exact words that Summer said to greet him and then conclude that if she said hey then she is a lesbian, is a real gem. The film is most truthful in moments like these and had it focused more on how pedantic people are in examining relationships it may have been even funnier. A great deal of the humour is also derived from the non-linear structure of the film, showing the conflict of emotions for Levitt's character as he moves in and out of his relationship. In one sequence he happily walks into the lift at his office but quickly the film fast forwards with the on screen day counter and Tom comes out of the same lift looking like a complete mess. Levitt is very good in having to move between such a variety of emotions. Yet given the film is dominated by Tom's perspective, it is unfortunate that Summer herself becomes a less interesting character. Though early on we learn that her parents' divorce left her not wanting a relationship and that she sporadically moves from being interested and thoroughly uninterested in Tom, her character feels quite hollow with little attempt to examine who she really is and why she is so unsure. She is a rather beautiful but less interesting figure of the film.Although one can appreciate (500) Days of Summer for attempting something different with the romantic comedy genre, this is still a rather disappointing and shallow film. Despite its elaborate structure, the film seems to have a very minimal number of new and interesting insights into the failures of a modern day relationship, beyond the see-saw of emotions that it produces for someone. The film has a number of surprising visual tricks, but if the same creativity had been placed into the screenplay it would have made for a much more memorable film. There are still laughs to be found though and Levitt remains a standout, just don't expect any long-term fulfilment.

The movie is from the point of view of the man instead of the woman in the relationship, which we don't see very often. It's a good take on modern relationships and it's a very relatable movie, which I think a lot of people will appreciate. In my opinion, this is one of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's best performances. He does a really good job of pulling you in and really making you feel what he feels.If I had to choose whether this movie falls more under the romance genre than a comedy, it's more of a romance. So if you're looking for a fast-pace, comedy with joke after joke, you probably won't enjoy this movie. If you like relatable movies with good actors to pull you in, and a different point of view on a romantic movie with occasional funny scenes, than you'll like this movie.

Weber, this creative movie follow the 'non-love story' happenings between Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon Levitt) and that of Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) through nonlinear narrative structure, with the story based upon its male protagonist and his memories of a failed relationship. It's so refreshing to see a romance movie from the guy's perspective. The film get a bit confusing at times as it jumps from various days within the 500-day span of Tom and summer's relationship, indicated by an animation that includes the day's number; this summary is a linear version of the events of the film. On the screens where the numbers of the days in the relationship are shown, the coloring and mood of the background art change to reflect the status of the relationship. Good days are brighter and bad days are darker. While, it can be predictable, because in the first frame we get to know they were going to break up, but having the love story relive thought the goods and bad days make the story seem new. It did help that the scene with them together, were a bit enjoyable even if both characters were being childish or rude to each other. Both protagonists were selfish and self-absorbed in their own way that some people may not like. I love Zooey and Joseph acting here, they're great friends in real life since 2001's Manic and they definitely brought that chemistry to the movie. You really thought they could have been in a relationship. I love all the jokes. The penis yelling joke, and living at IKEA joke are my favorite. 'Darling, I don't know how to tell u this but there's a Chinese family in our bathroom' cracks me up. I love the literal parody on an Ingmar Bergman film. Using 1957's The Seventh Seal is brilliant because it's both a reference and fits into the film perfectly! By losing to Cupid, it's a great symbol of the fate of the main character's relationship with Summer. Also great use of 1967's Graduate. While Tom sees true love, others see euphoria to ones showing more ambivalence. Many people interpret the ending to mean that the two ultimately realize how foolhardy their romantic escapade was or, at least, that they, both harbor doubts about the future. I wouldn't say this is a first date movie because of those scenes in 500 Days of Summer. It's really depressing when you think hard about it. If the humor wasn't so funny, I would have thought gees that isn't what I wanted to watch. You want the characters to have a happy ending ever because some people want to escape and believe that. Who goes on a first date to watch a break up movie? Its heart broking, and watching it felt like it. So, for does thinking it's a happy go lucky romantic movie: do warning. At less, the movie ends somewhat in a good note. It's a really odd film. How many romantic comedies movie do you know that have a disclaimer: ""Any resemblance to people living or dead is purely coincidental. Especially you, Jenny Beckman. Bitch"". Co-writer of the film Scott Neustadter admitted the film was based on a real romance of a real girl who inspired the character Summer. 500 Days of Summer is like a pop song in movie form. I love the great use of music. The scene had an amazing musical sequence after Tom and Summer first spend the night together. As Tom walks to work, he is overjoyed and struts down the street in a grand musical number set to the Hall & Oates song ""You Make My Dreams"" and others join his dance is just wonderful. I do like how Marc Webb created a music video as a companion piece to the film, titled ""The Bank Heist"". It features Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt dancing to ""Why Do You Let Me Stay Here?"", a song by Deschanel's folk group She & Him that help promote the film. Songs from the Smiths, Simon & Garfunkel also play a great part in the film. 'She's got you high' plays great in the credits. My favorite part of the film is the sequence where the screen is split in half. On one side is Reality. On the other, Expectations. The character Tom is going to a party being thrown by Summer. He is hoping to get back together after the break-up with 'Hero' by Regina Spektor playing in the background. We get to see the same scene played out differently. It's scenes like this that make the movie distinctive. Another unique scene is the documentary interview style about love and having Tom said nothing. That's speaks more than words. You would have thought this movie was directed by Woody Allen. It's so remind me of 1977's Annie Hall with all the fourth wall breaking, and European art house film references. Overall: I quite like this movie if it's has a disappointing ending. The romance genre really isn't as strong as other genres and I think it's because filmmakers are often too self-indulgent in these kinds of films. They make the sappy fantasies that people want to see, not necessarily what they need to see, if that makes any sense. Still, 500 days of Summer is careful to tell you that it is not a love story, which really isn't true. It's was marketed as love story. I do not think it really made sense to have a movie like this because most people go to movies to escape reality, not fact it. This movie is definitely about love, but it's just as much about breaking up and coming to terms with the aftermath. I think what they meant to say is that this film is not a conventional romantic comedy. Still, it's get an A+ in my book. "," Directed  Marc Webb,  written  Scott Neustadter  Michael H.

The fact is, you feel how you feel and you have no control over that. Summer was cynical about love, and set out to enjoy her time with Tom without an emotional investment. Tom, on the other hand was willing to put everything out there for this ""relationship."" Who was the more honest? Summer who made clear from the start she would remain detached emotionally? Or, Tom who was for the most part an open book when it came to what he wanted and what he was willing to risk for Summer? Both, in fact, were equal in their honesty. Both remained true to themselves. Although, you might argue that Summer was playing ""games"" in fact she was not. And, that is born out in the end when she finds someone who trips her trigger, so to speak. That is when she loses her cynicism and is capable of investing emotionally in a relationship. She just needed to meet the right person. That is how love works. Not to be forgotten, Tom, of course, is wounded by Summer's rejection. He laments the fact that she didn't tell him about her engagement, but the fact is he had been warned from the very beginning when he met Summer. A lot of pain can be avoided if we would just really listen to what we are being told and not just plow ahead because of what we think we want and need. As a result Tom becomes the bitter, hurt, and cynical one. And, that also is how love works. Love can put us on top of the highest peak or it can pull us down into the depths of hell. But, as with Summer, and as with Tom at the end, often when we feel we are incapable of loving, of committing, of sharing our time, and investing emotionally, we meet someone who makes us come alive and changes our perspective on love and life.

However, this relationship will have consequences.Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are two great, adaptable leads. Zooey has the quirky charm that is just right for Summer and Joseph has that nice-guy quietness that is good for Tom. I also like Chloe Grace Moretz's character. I love how a girl who is almost 2 decades younger than her brother is giving him love advice.Overall, this is a charming albeit realistic film. This film is honest and goes into detail that not all relationships are meant to be and not all have perfect, happy endings as shown in most movies. I liked the slapstick in the film especially with Tom's two friends. I also liked how Tom got into Hall and Oate's ""You Make My Dreams Come True.""

But the movie does tell you up front that it is not a love story, so goodbye happy ending. This was a depressing movie, because as a guy you are just willing Summer to come back to Tom. He is depressed for about half of the movie, and she keeps leading him back to crush him again. I loved the animation transition scenes and the scoring that went with them. It also indicated the state of the relationship on that day which helped keep everything in line since the movie was not in chronological order. The ending was a little sad since Tom had lost Summer forever,and the narrator says that he finally gave up on his dream of fate and finding ""the one"". However he meets a girl that appears to start a new chapter of his life. She introduces herself as Autumn and the animation changes to an fall theme and the number 500 winds back to 1.

I therefore expected it to fall short of my expectations, but I was incredibly, pleasantly surprised: (500) Days of Summer is, in fact, brilliant.The focus of this movie is love, one of the most prevalent themes in cinema, yet it is approached unconventionally here. This is no vapid romcom, no Nicholas Sparks-esque tear trigger, not even a tragedy reminiscent of Romeo and Juliet; rather, it is a study of how people feel and form relationships in the real world, and is therefore emotionally resonant on a level that most films don't reach.Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a hopeless romantic, ready to fall head-over-heels in love, yet Summer (Zooey Deschanel), the girl he decides is the love of his life, entertains no such fantasies, and is fundamentally opposed to relationships in general. Though they are apparently ill-fitted for one another, their lives intertwine over these 500 days, and they find themselves becoming... something. Something fuzzy and indistinct, something that looks different from each of their perspectives, something between friends and true lovers in sync with one another.Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel both deliver perfect performances. Tom is heartrendingly naive, experiencing true misery for the first time as he comes to realize that his view of the world has been wrong for too long, and Summer is not a caricature. It is evident that she feels just as much as Tom, albeit differently, and she is honest with him and herself right from the beginning. Neither character is entirely in the right or entirely in the wrong - they are real people coming face to face with the real questions of what love is and what it should be and how it is interpreted by different people.Though I really enjoy the story itself, the method of its telling adds significantly to its merit as a creative work. Elements of the story's setting and setup - they meet in a greeting card factory, Tom's teenage sister is the voice of reason on which he depends - establish the movie's quirkiness. Directorial and narrative decisions also add interest: there is an outer layer to the story (a narrator, decorative title cards that reflect the mood at the point in the story they reference, the fourth wall gets close to being broken); it is told out of order (hence the need for title cards establishing chronology); events and internal monologues are displayed creatively (split screens, scenes from foreign films). The ending - without giving anything away - is fabulous.(500) Days of Summer is my favorite kind of movie. It doesn't present a message heavy-handedly but does make you think, features great actors, and breaks Hollywood conventions. I would definitely recommend it.

I will note that this is the third or fourth film of Deschanels' that I've seen her sing. Despite her being able to hold a tune I don't understand why this is included in all of her films. It would be interesting to find out if it is the directors or Deschanel herself who request this to be added into the scripts (sometimes a little hurriedly). The layout of the film can be a little confusing to follow because the story is broken up into several pieces and they are not played in chronological order. It is a very clever way to lay out the film however and it did work really well for this.Overall, this is a delightful little film that deserves a bit more recognition.

There were scenes showing the two main characters doing something and then it changed to a different day. What kind of relationship were they even in?

One of the good points was the light-hearted humour - it was funny sometimes. Despite the film itself being quite light, it was at least mildly entertaining.

On that note, the film seemed light on plot. It felt like it was trying to preach a message about love.

I like it's simplicity, filmography is beautiful, and the soundtrack... just brilliant. The stars are also very good on it, I think they both are very talented (Zoey and Joseph) and they did a very good job. As said, this is not a love story, but a story about love. Which is great, pretty much what happens in real life, we get heartbroken, we love someone who doesn't love us back, we fall for complicated people, until we find the right person. That's is true, what happened to Tom happened to so many people... and I think that it was a great idea to make a film about that, since chick flicks with a happy ending and boys chasing girls in airports seems to be too far away from reality. But I didn't like the ending, or how Summer seemed so cold, what she felt for Tom was never clear, OK, she didn't love him, but she was with him, she had feelings for him, she missed him, she seemed in love at so many moments, but it was never clear. She wasn't a bad person, but the film makes you hate her at the end. Like she was a heartless girl, making a 'play toy' out of Tom. Which, I don't think was the case. I think the idea of the film is very good, but it ended up making a film about a poor guy, who was the victim, when maybe, Summer was also a victim, they both were.

I think this was an attempt to condition the audiences rather than anything else. The movie moves in a non-linear time line which makes the movie that much more interesting. The actors (Gordon-Levit and Zooey Deschanel) easily fill in the shoes of the characters. The characterization is so good that you simply do believe that these are people who could be a part of your life. The presence of friends (one with a girl-friend since school & one with no hope of getting a girl-friend) are so much part of anyone's life. The manager in the office, who realizes that his employee is going through a lean period thinks of using this phase to get him to create sad greeting cards rather than the happy love cards that he is used to creating. You can always find managers like this in your offices. The leads are characterized by their simplicity (the dressing sense of Tom, the dressing and the hair-style of Summer). As they grow closer, the air of confidence displayed by Tom is infectious. Their break-up breaks his heart completely. The scene in which Tom goes to the super market to buy some soda and drinks in his bathrobe is another scene which really shows the heart-break that this guy is going through. And then the finish. As they say, after every storm, there is a new start. Knowing that Summer is now finally out of his life, the way Tom re-starts his life, going after his long standing dream of becoming an architect. That's when he meets Autumn (named intelligently) at an interview. That's when the film ends, leaving it to the speculation of the audience on what would conspire between Tom & Autumn.

The (500) days of summer!!!! This is one of the best movies i've ever seen! We watch 500 days of an ordinary young couple. In contrast to other romantic comedies, he is an everyday guy, and she is a sweet girl. They face common problems, and they have the same feelings that we might had in a romantic relationship.

(500) Days of Summer,115,Michael Stavros,18/Dec/11,10,2.6590329512223e-07,film movie one not story well funny even best characters much love may never two only though people ever often character feel get audience really screen plot,,,inf,inf,inf," I love this movie so much that I'm jealous of it. If there is one screenplay I wish I had written, it would be this one. That's not to say the screenplay is the best ever written (I give that to The Godfather Part II), that its story has any sort of amazing complexity, or that the plot devices are necessarily anything never done before. Quite the opposite, but I love it nonetheless because its simple premise shows surprising depth and perfectly gets its characters down. I not only feel like I could meet these people on the street, but I have and they are some of my best friends. (500) Days of Summer is about a man's relationship with a woman shown through days in a non-linear sequence meant to show it as if our main character was recounting it in his head, a mishmash of memories. Our main character is Tom, a trained architect turned greeting card writer who meets his love interest Summer at the office. They quickly discover they have similar common unusual interests and get along well. Things are complicated however as Tom is all-in on the belief of true love after a watching of The Graduate when he was a kid, but Summer does not believe love exists and therefore is not interested in a relationship. The rest of the movie is told in a jumbled up manner going through the highs and lows of the relationship. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom and Zooey Deschanel as Summer have fantastic on- screen chemistry and you really do hope these two end up together. Though this all sounds melodramatic, its characters and circumstances are often very funny (especially one scene in particular featuring Han Solo, an animated bird, and Hall & Oates). A common complaint among fans, however, is its ending for being somewhat predictable. I wouldn't dare spoil it, but I absolutely love it for being able to manage to give the audience hope although Tom seemingly has none, as well as bringing the film full-circle. Well-written, absolutely true to real-life, and young actors working their asses off, this film is a shoe-in for my top 5 favorites and may even rise after more repeat viewings.10/10 ","  love  movie  much   jealous  .    one screenplay  wish   written,     one.  not  say  screenplay   best ever written ( give    Godfather Part II),   story   sort  amazing complexity,    plot devices  necessarily anything never done .

Now children, these weren?t bad people ? even good actors like John Cusack fell for the temptation of making a coupla? bucks off the 18-54, white, female, movie-going demographic. Ah, but children, there is hope in the form of video-director Marc Webb who has created a romcom with real (fake) emotion, actual laugh-out-loud moments and an intriguing plot which defies the traditional conventions of the subgenre yet still delivers a satisfying ending. The film is cast with a focus on brains over abs so that when Tom falls in love with and later can?t get over Summer we actually understand why and feel what he feels.

You know - the guy who thinks up lines in birthday cards and such, but in truth wants to mold the city-line. A romantic at heart he deftly falls in love with his new co-worker Summer (Zooey Deschanel). Jumping from across 500 days (to and fro) the movie presents us the high and lows of their relationship and break-up, as well as with the hardships with letting go of the love that keeps him bound to Summer. Everything pulsating with intelligent dialogue, subtle and funny humour, as well as with some really thoughtful input on sex, love and the other relationship stuff.Slightly experimental quirky romantic comedy with an intriguing scattered structure, which does not draw much comparisons to anything I've ever seen. And that's despite the fact that the movie is populated with pop-cultural references and borrowed scenes from other movies on an almost Tarantino-like level. Frontlining Joseph Gordon-Levitt, in my opinion the best actor of his generation (including i.e. Leonardo di Caprio) to such a strong script also does a multitude of favours for the movie, as he manages to sell the full range of emotions from love and passion to hate and despair seemingly without an effort. I do however find Zooey Deschanel unable to cope with the character and script she is offered (a feeling I see is not popular among viewers). The character she plays is irritating, self-centered and essentially unlikeable. I understand that relationships mean that opposites attract, but Summer is sold at the beginning of the movie through voice-over as the heart and soul of the universe, but ultimately she is scripted as a heartless, unbelievably selfish and egoistical vixen, which seems to conflict with earlier information on her person. That said Zooey's chemistry with Tom is spot on and albeit she never has the same screen presence as Gordon-Levitt she does an admirable back-up job, which helps the story flow and entrench us into the high-and-lows for their relationship. All in all the misgivings of her character have to be put on the shoulders of the script, but Zooey never seems to have the strength of character to convince me that she is worth the despair.Thankfully however Summer is a supporting character and despite relatively good screen-time she fades into the background of the emotions and feelings of Tom Hansen, who dominates the screen throughout the movie, even when singing ""The Pixies"" during drunken karaoke. The question essentially isn't whether Summer deserves Tom's admiration and love, but on the process he goes through and where it leads him to in life.Apart from Summer the remaining cast on the movie is extremely intriguing and likable, especially highlighted by a very influential minor role by ""Kick Ass""'s Chloe Moretz.I have minor issues with a couple of scenes, albeit one concerns the climax of the movie, when Tom quits his job. Tom basically starts throwing out nonsensical 'deep thoughts' in front off his work comrades, which seem forced and are a bit lacking in any substantial afterthought. Given this is a key scene it slightly hit the overall grading of this almost perfect movie. I always wasn't too keen on the solution of the movie and the way Tom passed on to Autumn. The whole sequence felt a bit stale - as if the scriptwriter got hit by a deadline and quickly pasted on the first ending that came to mind.In the end minus one for the character of Summer and another minus one for a couple of badly written scenes.

Chronologically, this film is out of whack, to say the least. But not until now am I realizing just how much this movie traveled back and forth across its story's timeline.

He once again does a bang on job of the very confused male (like that is rare) and Zooey Deschanel who i am still wondering how she is going to do when she stars as Janis Joplin in the upcoming bio, is the very confusing love interest here who wants a relationship without labelling it so...or at least thats what i got from her character. either that or she was afraid of commitment needless to say it was a nice change seeing the role reversal here as according to Hollywierd usually has the woman being the jaded one. thats where Marc Webbs genius comes into play. Need to mention Criminal Mind's Matthew Gray Gubler has a small part in this although being nice to see him act another character then Dr. Spencer Reid, that's unfortunately all i kept seeing every time i saw him on screen.

No, this movie is a simple relation of a life experience I imagine we all go through, that of falling so madly in ""love"" with someone we lose reality and can't see the glaring signs of destruction ahead and those equally opposing bitter feelings when reality comes crashing in when we realize that person we are obsessed with isn't obsessed back.If you are looking to have your mind blown away and a new perspective plopped right into it, this probably isn't the film for you.

Every now and then a rare thing will happen where a movie has this irresistible charm and can be viewed repeatedly. 500 Days of summer is such a movie. From the first frame, I knew this movie was for me. I love quirky characters and indie soundtracks, so it not be an exaggeration to say the movie won me over at the beginning. The story is something anyone can relate too. Boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, girl is indifferent and despite seeming like the one, further scrutiny would tell a different story. I thought the two man actors, Joseph and Zooey had amazing chemistry. Their uncomfortable moments made me uncomfortable, their tender moments put a smile on my face, etc. I just felt the portrayal of a relationship was spot on, warts and all, without coming off as cheesy or smoothed over. Plus, the smith nods? :) I love this movie!! There are no villains, and I think this is the sign of a great work when instead of finger pointing, it relates that sometimes things do not work out and it is nobody's fault. I know a lot of people will hate Summer and her character, but by the end, I felt happy to know she was happy and saw Joseph's character accept her resolve, and say that he wants her to be happy. Beautiful. Saying to someone you've loved you wish them happiness outside of your embrace, that takes immeasurable strength. The moment had me in tears, because it is rare you are able to see such poignant grace. 10/10PS The Regina Spektor song at the beginning owns my life, I love the soundtrack to this movie. :) x5 ","  movies,  enjoy thoroughly    hard pressed  watch  .  now    rare thing will happen   movie   irresistible charm  can  viewed repeatedly. 500 Days  summer    movie.   first frame,  knew  movie   .  love quirky characters  indie soundtracks,   not   exaggeration  say  movie won     beginning.  story  something anyone can relate .

Nothing more than a sweet, touching, and believable antics do Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel get into. I should state, like in the movie, that this is a story of ""Boy meets girl"". It is in no way ""A love story"". This is a movie, that surpasses the title of ""Just another quirky Romantic Comedy"".The movie is about sweet and simple Tom Hansen(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who looks and frets over the ""girl of his dreams"". He is an architect, though works as a Greeting Card Maker of all jobs. One day, his boss gets a new assistant, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschannel). Tom is in the love at first site stage. He denies it, but the fact of the matter is it's undeniably true.After learning Summer like the same music as he does, Tom tries to hint Summer he likes her and wants to go out. After numerous attempts fail, he sucks it up and spends time with her. The duo play the ""mommy and daddy"" like relationship. Going to Ikea to pretend the appliances are actually theirs and frequently going out to dinner.The storyline and chronological order of the movie overall impresses me to great extent. It's played out in days, though skips frequently so the audience doesn't have to watch everyday, throughout.When something goes well in Tom's life, it flashes to a point in the movie were something doesn't go right. Tom than becomes almost obsessed with Summer and believes she is the girl for him and nothing can stop him from ""winning her over"".After various uses of quotations around different love quotes I should state my reasoning that this movie takes a lot of aspect of all the love terms out there and uses a bit of each one. The director of this movie, Marc Webb, in which this is his debut film, does a wonderful job with this movie.(500) Days of Summer is not by any means a love story. It's a true visionary piece composed of stunning lines and a beautiful relationship between Joesph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschannel who very much could be a couple more than just on screen.Starring: Joesph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschannel.

(500) Days of Summer,128,tyler-and-jack,04/Jul/10,8,4.2316826807882494e-10,movie one not story good comedy well even best much love just makes may still fun made cast many ever feel romantic kind man get really seen moments,,,inf,inf,inf," Directed by Marc Webb and written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, (500) Days Of Summer is, as we are told from the very beginning, NOT a love story. But it IS all about love. And happiness. And pain. And stupidity. And, basically, everything that comes in the package when we open ourselves up to be with someone we really, truly want to be in love with.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Tom Hansen, a young man who writes trite, sentimental messages for a greeting card company while dreaming of one day being an architect. His best friend, McKenzie (played by Geoffrey Arend), is really not that helpful to him but that's not a major problem because, well, he's his best friend. If he needs any proper, sensible advice then Tom simply asks his young sister (Chloe Moretz) and gets her perspective on things. Which is exactly what he needs when he meets Summer (Zooey Deschanel), the woman who he thinks may just be the one for him, his destiny, his soulmate, his other half. But is this really the case or is Tom simply looking back at the highlights of a relationship that, like so many others, was actually made up of just as many bad signs as it was good? Coming across like some hybrid of Amelie and Lost In Translation, this movie manages to deliver a truckload of romantic comedy clich Ãs while still managing to feel as if it's not conforming to the accepted template of the modern romantic comedy. It kind of manages to have it's cake and eat it, in a very enjoyable way.Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes for a very likable lead and Zooey Deschanel makes it easy to fall in love with her in every movie she's ever been in so that's no stumbling block here either. The supporting cast all do well and have a lot of fun on the fringe of someone dissecting a relationship they thought would be their last.Stylistically, the movie is fresh and vibrant and manages to jump around in the timeframe of the relationship to offset the bad times with some soaring moments of happiness. We get homages, a song and dance number, some fun with card rhymes, cringeworthy karaoke and some very nice pencil sketches both on paper and on the actual movie scenery itself.The reason this scores so highly is thanks to that freshness and unique feeling it manages to keep from beginning to end but, perversely, the reason it does not score any higher is because we have all ultimately seen it all before. Despite the dressings and accessories, there's really nothing here that we haven't seen before. It's just a good job that it's done so well and should appeal to the romantic in every viewer, even when it's not so apparent that it is still very much a movie about love and all that entails.

It is not your typical love story; it touches on something a lot of romantic comedies do not: unrequited love. The film shows the damage that can be caused by being in a nonexclusive relationship, which is something that is not shown very often. It puts a different perspective on the dating game, which I really enjoyed.A highlight of the movie is the documentary segment which includes four or five views on love from various characters in the film. It has quite possibly one of the most powerful quotes about relationships that I have seen in a movie. The character Paul says: ""Robyn is better than the girl of my dreams. Why is that? She's real."" All in all, I would definitely suggest checking this movie out. There is nothing that I dislike about it.

I think the biggest reason why some people couldn't bring themselves to like this movie is because it is about young love, and many who are older and ""wiser"" (more or less) can't understand or appreciate that anymore. They think it is silly and juvenille and won't put themselves in the character's place. Weren't they that age once? And the other reasons are among the I-hate-everything-and- expect-an-Oscar-worthy-movie-every-time-i-turn-on-my-TV or they simply believe this is over rated and overthink it way too much, not to mention magnify or come up with flaws. Or, they found themselves hating the main characters just because they have different personality types and are unable to relate to them. Anyway, this movie is astoundingly original in the way it is written and the story itself, Zoeey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt are both talented actors/actresses and have great chemistry together, and it's a very relatable story that makes us soft-hearted personality types feel warm inside after watching. The music is also great. The thing I love most about this movie was how realistic it is; too many times you see a movie when in the end, the protagonist always ends up back with his long lost lover. They get together, break up, make up, happily ever after. 500 days of summer breaks this clich Ãd plot and tells a tragically real boy-meets-girl story of unrequited love. And, we are still left with an ending that makes us feel good.

Channeling an honesty and charm, to define (500) Days of Summer as a romantic-comedy feels like an injustice. At the very least, it proves that not all romantic-comedies are created equal.(500) Days of Summer chronicles the full relationship of Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel). Tom, a trained architect, works at a greeting card company in Los Angeles. He is a hopeless romantic raised on The Graduate with the belief that he is destined to meet his perfect girl and future wife. Summer arrives to the office as the new assistant of Tom's boss. She is a free spirit without a true belief in romantic love. Tom immediately falls for Summer. The rest of the film tells their story from start to finish, covering all of the ups and downs that occur in their relationship.The film uses a non-linear style to tell its story, hopping from each important day of the relationship, often juxtaposing the feelings of a young relationship with those of a dying one. From the first time this is employed I fully expected to hate this style. Following Pulp Fiction, this non-linear style of storytelling could be seen left and right. While Pulp Fiction is able to use this style quite effectively, crafting a film that cannot be imagined in any other way, other films felt more kitsch than functional in their attempts to make something ""edgy"". Imagine my surprise when I found myself fully enjoying the way the technique is used in (500) Days of Summer. At no point is the style distracting, rather it feels necessary. The film is a chance for Tom to consider his relationship with Summer, and we feel more as voyeurs to his experience. When reminiscing on a past relationship, you do not revisit linearly and in this way, it makes sense for the film to hop from moment to moment.The success of the film derives from its honesty. In a time where Hollywood is spewing out fantastical ideas of the modern romance with films like Twilight and Dear John, (500) Days of Summer is a breath of fresh air. The writers, Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, put together scenes that are so authentic that it makes you wonder why they aren't put on screen more often. The relationship starts awkwardly, with Tom expressing a curious shyness and fear of destruction that accompanies those first conversations with a new love. The degradation of the relationship never feels forced or sudden; rather Summer drifts from Tom organically making Tom's ultimate heartbreak all the more realistic.The film does however, still prescribe to some romantic-comedy clich Ãs. Summer at times, comes across as your typical ""manic pixie dream girl"", with such a desire to simply remain ""free"" that often lacks believability. Tom's quirky friend McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) and his best friend Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler) feel incomplete as characters and seem to exist simply to allow Tom to communicate his feelings vocally. However, the character of Rachel (Chlo Ã Moretz), Tom's sassy and wise beyond her years little sister, manages to overcome her clich Ã and remain rooted in the real, something that should be attributed to the chemistry between Gordon-Levitt and Moretz.The film deserves credit for reveling in its indie quirkiness. With a ""voice of God"" narration by Richard McGonagle, that gives the film an occasional fairytale quality, there is a freshness that doesn't go unnoticed. At the very least, the film deserves credit for being the first on screen presence of the oft played by adolescents ""penis game"", and the admission that on their best day, every guy can feel like Han Solo. It does rest on the occasional clich Ã, but (500) Days of Summer succeeds in being an honest romantic-comedy for a new generation.

There is no escape from love, either Tom or Summer. I think thiz is the best modern romantic drama since ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" in 2004. The couple is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. We have recently seen Gordon-Levitt in ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" (2009). The Director is Marc Webb. The chemistry of Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel is very well. The characters seem so easy-going and believable. The movie is filled with good music to describe the highs and lows of love. The movie simply brings us into the mood of love easily, where sometimes there are laughter and joy, and the other times there are hesitation and sadness. In several scenes, they keep asking each other, ""where will thiz relationship goes to?"" If you love somebody that just happens and you could tell her anytime and anywhere, it doesn't matter where the place is. Maybe it is not that simple, but we know even love doesn't last forever, but commitment does. The ending is far from idealistic, but more close to reality. Like I have said many times before, if you want to make a great love story, you cannot have the couple stay together in the ending. You have to provide the tragic element. You can see thiz fact from ""Romeo + Juliet"" (1996) to ""The Titanic"" (1997) and other similar love stories.

I remember that I was just looking pages on internet, and I saw the movie (the poster) but I just ignored it. Some days later, I saw the movie poster again, so I came here and searched for it and I saw it has good rating, and it was about romance and I use to like movies like that. so, I decided to watch it.... And I absolutely don't regret it. The movie starts with almost the end... so, I thought it was going to ruin the movie because I thought there was a happy ending between them and they'd last, but then, there's Tom sad and angry because Summer dumped him, but he says he would get her back, which I thought he would do. But then, throughout the movie is a funny and happy story of Tom and Summer, which at the end, I thought it was sad... Not the typical romantic movie with a happy ending. It is a smart story, and well told, and you can easily relate with the characters.Zooey and Joseph give an amazing and smart role, and it was well acted. Another thing that I like about this movie, is the soundtrack... One of the bests I've heard! Thanks this movie, I found the Smiths, and I specially loves the Song ""Hero"", it takes me to the movie, to that particular scene which I think is the most ""tragical"" and sad. The climax of the story. Expectations vs. Reality. And the songs reflects the movie, and the feelings of the Character's, specially Tom's.This movie is worth watching, heart touching, funny, happy, but sad, and it's so realistic. At the beginning, you are warned that this is not a love story, and I think it's true, but not at all... It is a smart love story, a realistic one (I am not saying that love stories with happy endings are not realistic) and I think that's why I loved it! As i say before, you can easily relate to the plot, and you can feel character's feelings and emotions.One of my favorites movies ever....

Perhaps one of the reasons that critics were so taken by it is that it is more a story of realistic relationship...sad perhaps but true. Redeemable almost entirely by the sole performance of the male lead but unlike most typical ""romance"" movies the female lead is almost entirely unlikable. It isn't the fault of the actress but rather the story that really paints the male character as the deeply emotional, sensitive, and sweet guy and pair him with a commitment phobic, and almost un-emotional girl. The film runs through the almost two years of their on again, off again ""friendship"" in various stages and does truly demonstrate every possible range of the relationship. The film has a sweet indie feel to it with some really nice settings and nature like cinematography.Essentially there are two performances in this film that matter at all. The supporting cast is scarce and while they all are decent, there aren't any truly outstanding supporting roles. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is really making a name for himself and I expect he has a big, big role in his future. For the time being he seems to be set into the indie circuit but giving some impressive performances. In this film he borderlines being almost whiny but fortunately stays on the side of truly likable. As Tom Hansen he shows a truly soft side that will make most women melt and most guys feel sensitive...secretly. Has Zooey Deschanel ever had a truly good role? She was decent in Elf. She should have been banned from acting after The Happening. She gives a decent performance in this film but is unfortunately tasked with a very bad character. She has so many emotional problems that she comes across as cold to the man who falls in love with her. They have good chemistry but you get so attached to how Gordon-Levitt feels that you despise Deschanel for hurting him.There is an unfortunate stigma attached to both primarily TV directors, and music video directors. Marc Webb has very little experience on a big screen film and customary to many music video directors they think the best style is to flip through various scenes to tell a story which can sometimes lead to it being rushed and seem like a mish-mash of ideas. The story not always being in chronological order doesn't help but is fairly easy to follow along thanks to the 500 days concept and the naming of what day they are in to their relationship. It has to be said in an off topic I think the idea of Marc Webb being pegged for the Spiderman reboot is a terrible one both pun wise and director wise. The writing team of Michael Weber and Scott Neustadter are new to Hollywood and their only other claim to fame is The Pink Panther 2 (nuff said.) (500) Days of Summer is entertaining and will definitely have you talking by the end of it like gossip bad mouthing Deschanel for what she has done to Tom. See it but don't expect a lovely romance, its rather harsh. 7/10 ","    incredibly hard  convince   (500) Days  Summer   romance   kind.

(500) Days of Summer,135,JustStone,08/Apr/10,6,5.420327848034722e-10,film movie one not story comedy will well even films time best love just makes work little enough still look never two only heart without ever something years character feel year romantic kind get seen isnt right dont,,,inf,inf,inf," Have you ever seen Say Anything? Or for the matter any John Cusack movie from the 80's? Let me give you a short summery: boy is a kindhearted, hopeless romantic that believes in love, and the ""one in a million girl"" he falls for is cute (bangs for bonus points) cool, quirky, yet passive, icy heart breaker. Well if you've seen those, then you're familiar with 500 Days of Summer a romantic comedy, that's a ""story of boy meets girl...but not a love story"" yeah that was said by the narrator of the film, and yeah its has crappy narration.A year ago an article in the onion pinpointed a certain kind of female archetypical character named ""The Manic Pixie Dream Girl"". Basically it explains a style of film about a live-in-the-moment hyperactive super cute girl that a dopey guy falls in love with not only for her charm and vitality, but for the ride of unexpected spur of the moment events she brings him on that helps remind him what its like to feel alive. 500 days of Summer falls right dab in the middle of this category because the main character, Summer (Zooey Deschanel), is the epitome of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl.Then there is the indie namedropping, ohh, the indie namedropping. This movie tries so hard to appeal to the alternative crowd it makes Juno look innocent. From its role-call of indie fav's from yesterday and today (The Smiths, The Pixies, Regina Spektor...Ringo) to its too cute, schmaltzy, over endearing quality, this movie wants to be Garden State without the sincerity or Natalie Portman. Its as if the film tries to convince you a quirky relationship never existed before these two got together and did ""crazy"" stuff like go into IKEA's living room section and pretend to be a married couple watching TV. Or rent a porno together and try some of the positions, because, you know, regular girls just aren't weird enough for something that zany. This film should become the mad libs template for the hopeless romantic guy falling for the too cool alt. girl (including the two best guy friends and a wise beyond her years little girl) its nothing more, nothing less. John Cusack eat your broken heart out.Oh, if you're still reading this, there is one other gripe I have about these types of films, and it's about the nature of these kinds of relationships. Listen guys, here is a tip if you identify with Tom (Joseph Gordan-Levitt) plight: it's not going to work. Any time (in any sort of relationship) if one person is more in love with the other then the other is with them, then it will be one sided and unbalanced. Plus obsessing over a girl is an unattractive quality. Show some backbone and don't fall for the sentiment of these types of films. There is nothing wrong with being romantic, but being an obsessive whiner isn't going to get you anywhere, even if you're holding a boom box over your head...unless you're Ben Gibbard, but you're not.

Somehow they can always manage to find feel good, fresh, and original films that typically have a mainstream marketability and yet still seemingly has that indie charm, (500) Days of Summer isn't one of them. This movie has to be, without a doubt, the most wannabe, pretentious film I have ever seen. Many scenes it becomes so blatantly obvious that the writer's of this film thought that they were just spinning out magic. That's not to imply that there isn't any passion here, I just don't think the film, nor writers behind it, are entirely deserving of this so-called praise that's surrounding the film. As bad as this film wants you to believe, there's nothing independent about this film; in the sense that this film doesn't possess this original, witty charm that it wants you to think it does. It's as if they watched every successful romantic comedy/ independent film and tried to mimic what they did __ and believe me, it's not as wonderful as it sounds. Never have I rolled my eyes so many times at a film, strictly because every scene oozes with ""Oh wouldn't this be so original,"" or ""oh this is going to be so witty! This'll definitely get us that WGA membership.""Elaborate you ask? Let's start with the blatant use of ""off the wall"" humor: To exemplify how this Summer is supposedly such an extraordinary person who makes an impact anywhere she goes, it portrays her as having a charm so profound that some major study shows ice cream sales increasing all because she was working in a parlor or something. SO original. And a comedic approach to Tom's depression? Breaking plate after plate after plate. SO quirky! Why couldn't this film be in 3D on the off chance that a shard of the plate fly into my eyeballs? And the wisecracking down-to-earth little sister, and what's that, she curses to? That is SO funny. It's not entirely that these are bad things, they're not, they are- to a certain degree- original or at least have potential but it's all too much of a desperate attempt to seem likable and to achieve ""greatness"" they haven't earned. I imagine the film was planned like this: ""Let's do this love story, but an ANTI love story (although there's nothing really anti about it), and this guy will have the most random, quirkiest job we can think of, and he'll be smitten with her with a Smiths reference (because nothing screams great indie musical taste like the Smiths __ hipster thinks he's cool because he listens to the Smiths?). Oh and there has to be this drunken karaoke bar scene and he'll sing a Pixies song! What Pixies song would ever be in karaoke machine, maybe ""Where is My Mind,"" never ""Here Comes Your Man.""The film's execution of their so-called romance is even more infuriating. You mean to tell me that for 500 days, a little over a year, this crap went on? Really? It's not that the writing is lazy, the sad part really is that the writers think it's good. Apparently some think it is because I'm appalled at this film's rating and praise, not only most is it the most pretentious film ever made, but it surely also is one of the most overrated films ever. I especially hate how, not only the writers, but critics note how real the relationship is, you mean the one that was dead on arrival? The one where Summer didn't want a real relationship and only considered Jeff her friend, even though they showered and had sex together? You expect me to buy that? And don't tell me that the film intentionally does this, because otherwise it wouldn't have wasted our time. And even if that were the case (can we say cop out?), what does that say about the audience? Oh but it's the journey that makes it worth it? Can you say the same about films where in the end it's all a dream?The film has some degree of likability to it: The film looks beautiful, and the ongoing joke with Ringo Star, even the ending (not the very last scene however, ugh, again, SO funny) Nevertheless, Zooey Deshanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt play their characters well enough to make me want to like them, but again, they did nothing to earn my sympathy or care. If the film had suddenly taken a violent turn and have their entire office burn down and kill everyone inside? I wouldn't have cared. Maybe it caught me on a bad day, or maybe it just sucked? I guess a lot of people disagree with me, and I guess generally speaking I would recommend it, but personally I wouldn't because this one just didn't do it for me.

The guy's a hopeless romantic but resilient enough to get over heartbreak (though not before a bout of depression), and the girl's a secret romantic who hides behind her motto that she doesn't believe in love (till she finds it). And even though they have a nice romance, relationships don't always work out, often because one party is just not as into the other, and it's really no one's fault. C'est la vie and moving on. And it's great that the movie ends on an appropriately positive - if not cheesy - note. Downer finales don't really befit romcoms.

The clich Ã endings and the unrealistic relationships between characters are repeated in movie after movie. So after viewing (500) Days of Summer I'm relieved to say that there is now at least one film that explores the realism of relationships and break-ups. There are so many times in this movie where I could relate to the main character. I often found myself screaming out at the television, ""Oh My God the exact same thing happen to me."" The film follows the relationship between Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel). According to Tom everything seems to be going fantastic and he honestly believes that Summer is the woman for him. However, after less than a year of dating she decides to end things. Tom is shocked to say the least and goes through an era of depression almost as long as the relationship was itself. Let's face it, it happens to everybody and (500) Days of Summer shows how quickly your feelings can change from being completely in love with someone to hating them beyond words. There are so many interesting scenes that each explore different aspects of relationships. For example, in one fantastic sequence the filmmaker divides the screen in half, one-side showing what Tom expects to happen and on the other side displaying what actually happens. Tom expects that Summer and him will get back together and have a romantic evening. However, in reality she simply invited him to the party just to be nice, and already had another love interest. (500) Days of Summer is unlike any other romantic comedy ever made. This is because its focus is not on presenting a feel good movie or giving the audience a happy ending, but it is to demonstrate that everyone goes through the hardships of relationships and break-ups.

Finally a movie that doesn't give you the happily ever after crap from Hollywood. A lot of people, after being exposed to hundreds of romantic comedies a la Hollywood, have come to believe that there is just one right person out there for you in the whole wide world. They are obsessed with the thought of missing out on their one true soul mate. I must admit, I myself had this beautiful naive vision of love during my teen years, but like Tom Hansen (JGL) in this story, I had to learn the hard way to grow up and mature in love matters. What I loved about this movie, is that the love story is told trough the eyes of the protagonist (JGL), it is ultimately the real way we experience love. Trough his eyes we get to see the ups and downs that he lives in his relationship. Take for example, the scene where he starts to sing and dance on the street after spending the night with Summer (Zooey Deschanel). It was a pure joy to watch and I could truly identify myself with him. When love hits you hard you get the feeling you are walking on a cloud. Another great example to show us his particular vision of things is the scene were the screen splits in two. He is about two enter the party of Summer and on one screen we see what his expectations are and on the other what happens in reality. This scene was precious to me, it shows you in a very plastic way the tricks that the mind can play on you. Of course the downfall is pretty hard. My compliments to the two lead actors, they do a great work and the chemistry between them shows. The supporting actors also deliver very well and give some good comic relief. The soundtrack is also very beautiful and the songs help us understand the feelings of Tom Hansen. I cannot forget to mention the cinematography of the film. It includes some wonderful shots of the city of Los Angeles. I used to think of LA as a rather ugly city, but it seems I was wrong. But what really deserves a special recognition is the editing in the movie. I am sure a lot of people found the back and forth in the storytelling confusing, but it was made this way for a purpose. When you think about the bad and good moments of a past relationship you will not be capable of remembering them in a straight linear way, it will all be a little mixed up, just like in this movie. Well, let's don't blabber any more and jump to a conclusion. If you love the fairytale love stories this movie is not for you. But if you want to see a love story much more down to earth and take a good look on the right and wrong turns a relationship can take, this movie is for you. In the end the movie tries to tell you that life is all about grasping the right opportunities. Will you make the right choice and give this movie a chance?

The truth is that the storyline is visible five minutes in, so you shouldn't worry about them.Romance movies can go awry easily. It's easy for them to be forced, fatalistic and silly to the point of self-parody (Which isn't a problem if you intend it, but it's often unintentional.) or depressing dirges about the futility of life and love reminiscent of a poem from a recently-single teenager. Even ignoring those issues, they usually depend heavily on the performances of the leads, so that if one of the actors isn't quite up to the task the film suffers mightily. ""(500) Days of Summer"" finds ways around all of the pitfalls of romances with a level of intelligence, silliness, and feeling that is truly inspired.It's pretty much the standard American film love story. The narrator tells us this right away. (He does say ""this is not a love story,"" but rather a ""boy meets girl story."") However, even before that, the hilarious opening title cards tell us that this isn't going to be taken 100% seriously. We start out with our protagonist, Tom, in a depressed state about his recently-ended relationship and then, jumping through time throughout the relationship, we get entire arc of their relationship, from meeting to demise, and a little beyond. However, it's the way in which we move through the story, knowing the end and the beginning, that holds our attention. The device of showing us which day it is outlives its usefulness after about twenty minutes, since we're really just moving among three time frames, but the structure allows us to see the relationship's development piecemeal, so that some ""mystery,"" so to speak, remains throughout. The ending is also both somewhat surprising and absolutely perfect.The film's attitude of a mixture of deep emotion and pure silliness also helps it move along. When Tom is happy because he kissed Summer, we not only get him walking down the street happy, we get a full-on music video that even goes so far as to include a happy little cartoon bluebird. That scene also pays off wonderfully later when Tom finally realizes that the relationship is over and staggers into the dark streets, and our memory of that earlier instance gives it a powerful emotional punch.As for the acting that is such a problem for so many romances, this film avoids that problem by (a) focusing on just one of the leads so that the other really doesn't have to do anything and (b) casting Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Gordon-Levitt has, without much fanfare, built an incredible body of work that shows him to be among the finest and most versatile actors alive, and in this film we see him trying on another new hat--being a vulnerable, insecure young man who thinks he lives in a fairy tale and then can't stand to see his sand castle get washed away. Zooey Deschanel is very pretty, but she's not a good actor. In this film, it really doesn't matter, because she has so little to do. There are a few scenes where her limitations are definitely a problem (Her final scene, her ""apology"" to Tom after he gets in the fight, and the first kiss scene come to mind.), but not enough to really get in the way of what is otherwise such an excellent film. The supporting performances are all fine but require little.What little criticism I can make of the film is threefold. First, the calendar-like counting of the days really grew annoying once the time frames had been set--we knew where we were in the relationship anyway, so we didn't need that reference. Second, the narrator's presence, after introducing the story, was obtrusive and unnecessary. While we're seeing something unfold on the screen, he unnecessarily pops in to tell us what it means. This problem was most prevalent when he talked about Summer opening up her world to Tom. We could see that happening--the camera-work told us, the set told us, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt told us. We didn't need the big disembodied voice to chime in as well and it was distracting as a result. Third, Zooey Deschanel's weak performance, as mentioned above.Overall, a truly excellent film that has enough humor to entertain people, a great ending, and excellent emotion.

The genre is so beyond tired, predictable and unrealistic fantasies that little girls need to tell themselves that they're going to find their prince charming one day and will live happily ever after. When 500 Days of Summer was released, I thought it was going to be the same thing, but this movie kept on getting all these great reviews, so I decided to suck it up and see what it was about. Holy God, I cannot believe there is a romantic comedy that is not only funny but extremely realistic and very well told. This is the kind of story that brings us back down to Earth, because everyone has had this type of a romance in their lives. Wither you're a realist or a hopeless romantic, this movie will work for you. The two lead actors: Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel worked so well together and were just a pleasure on screen. Both characters have faults, but still remain very lovable people and are someone to relate too.Tom Hansen meets Summer Finn, the new assistant to his boss. Tom trained as an architect but works as a writer at a greeting card company, living in Los Angeles. Following a karaoke night, Tom's co-worker, McKenzie, lets slip that Tom is attracted to Summer. Over the next few months Summer and Tom grow closer, despite Summer making it clear to Tom that she does not believe in true love, and does not want a boyfriend. Summer and Tom split up after they see The Graduate, a film which Tom thinks shows true love. Tom does not take the break up well, and Tom's friends call his younger sister, Rachel, to calm him down. Summer quits the greeting card company and Tom's boss moves him to consolations, as his depression is not suitable for happier events.I've had my ""Summer"" and I'm sure I've been a ""Summer"" to men before, that's why I loved this movie so much. For once this was a movie that I could relate too on a lot of levels. The director took a lot of risks with this movie and I loved the way it paid off. One of my favorite shots that I've just been bragging about to my friends and family was when Tom is invited to Summer's party, he's thinking that it's because she's starting to like him again as a love interest, so the director split's the screen as ""Expectations"" and ""Reality"". Tom goes into the party with a split screen of what he is expecting as Summer is so excited to see him and they reconnect, but in his reality vision, she's happy to see him, but he realizes that it's not the kind of happy that she's loving him again. Even the supporting cast, we don't have a clich Ã of characters, we have real friends and family that we would have in life. 500 Days of Summer is a charming movie and such a breath of fresh air that Hollywood can still pull in original ideas and make a romantic comedy that is not only funny, but heart warming as well. The ending is guaranteed to leave a smile on your face.9/10 ","     fan   reviews,  know one   ultimate hatred  romantic comedies.  genre    tired, predictable  unrealistic fantasies  little girls need  tell    going  find  prince charming one day  will live happily ever .  500 Days  Summer  released,  thought   going     thing,   movie kept  getting   great reviews,   decided  suck    see    .

The opening scene by itself was a surprise as it showed a couple holding hands, smiling silently, with the lady wearing an engagement ring, sitting on a bench in a public park with an ambiance which was far from being anything we would call sunny! More like a shot from Woody Allen's earlier works. But in this case it was not New York, but LA. From there it began. And what a ride it was.500 Days of Summer The story is narrated in a non-linear fashion, but less intrusive & easier to follow than a Nolan's movie. You easily get into the flow of narration in a couple of shots. It is so wonderfully intuitive. Now let's get into the movie.The speaker in the background says that this is yet another 'Boy meets a girl' movie but not a love story! You would be intrigued because how else these candy floss movies could otherwise be made. But the director adds a punch inside the movie which would strike a chord with every man in the world, one time or the other in his life__ The movie begins, as said before, with a couple holding hands effusing warm feelings. The very next scene throws you into the utter chaos which the lead of the movie, Tom has created. Tom is an average Greeting card writer who aspires to become an architect (which he had studied in the college) and is highly dissatisfied with his mundane job. Then comes Summer, who doesn't literally blow away Tom's life like a hurricane, but enters his world slowly. Tom feels a particular attraction towards with Summer, the first time he sees her. But Summer doesn't. She has a peculiar way of looking at things, claiming that 'true love' is an adult version of Santa and is extremely commitment-phobic. Then begins a series of courtship between the lead characters, which captures every aspect of emotional turbulence that every pair in the world goes through.The ups and downs that Tom goes through in the relationship and for a lesser extent what Summer goes through is shown at such a frantic pace that you literally laugh and feel sad at the same time. The script is so fast paced, that you don't have time to feel the hangover of the previous scene. The lead characters are also well developed and you wouldn't find them behaving in clich Ãd ways. Humour in this movie is so subtle that you actually laugh without understanding why you are laughing in the first place! The dialogues are crisp and insightful. Some words like 'I felt something for him, which I never was sure in your case' are just so plain yet powerful. One should watch the movie carefully to appreciate these jewels.The background score and other songs in the movie perfectly blend with various moods portrayed. Marc Webb's music videos background shows up clearly in this movie. The song Tom dances to when he's happy is a treat to the eyes. But gives a 'been there-seen that' feeling.The same scenes revisited in different moods show different meanings. And then again all this boils down to how our mind interprets things the way it wants to see it. The expectation / reality sequence is so original and the way it is shot is simply superb. It appears that one can never best the way Tom's disappointment is shown in the movie.In the climax, the movie really appears to fall into the usual clich Ã tic ending. But Webb pulls it back into reality and avoids the mistake so many others have made before. And in the end the movie ends in Ivan Goncharov's 'Same Old Story' fashion, where the protogonists' views of the world become interchanged(which btw is perfectly the way things turn out in the real world). Webb has artfully wefted in so many different feelings that one can possibly go through in a relationship in this compact 90 minute delight. All in all, 500 days of Summer is definitely a 'not to be missed' movie.

You know the one. The movie that has the girl falling for the guy, then a dilemma develops, they fall apart, only to be brought back together by serendipity {play romantic chorus here}.Well this isn't that kind of movie, thank you very much...This is something newer, something I like to call ""a romantic guy flick."" No, it's not some horny dude looking to plop his thing into any attractive gal that comes along (KNOCKED UP) or some roadtrip movie gone awry (THE HANGOVER). This is a story of unrequited love ...from the man's side. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (THE LOOKOUT) stars as Tom, a guy wanting nothing more than to fall in love with the girl of his dreams. And he believes he's found her in Summer (Zooey Deschanel, THE HAPPENING). Trouble is Summer only wants to be ""friends with benefits."" She tells Tom this from the get-go, but Tom's having none of it. He believes he can turn her toward him and onto a path of blissfulness.The film juxtaposes their 500 days together in a unique pattern: by traversing the days in a haphazard fashion, jumping from day 490 to day 39, then on to day 65 and back to day 1. This is representational of Tom's need to find out what went wrong with their relationship, as Summer breaks it off and devastates Tom. Or did anything go wrong? Perhaps Tom simply wasn't listening ...or being unrealistic in his expectations of Summer.Whatever the reason, many lonely guys out there will probably be able to identify with ""that girl that broke my heart"" syndrome that Tom goes through. This is what makes (500) DAYS OF SUMMER the guy flick I referred to earlier. It is frustrating, funny, and downright depressing. Doubly so when we see Summer hold hands with Tom even after there is no hope for them, further confounding Tom's sense of right and ...love.Even though there's a depressing air to the entire film, it does have its lighter moments thanks to two of Tom's buddies who are absolutely clueless about relationships yet offer their ridiculously bad advice to him. Tom's kid sister Rachel (Chloe Moretz) plays the sounding board and only person who seems to have a grip on what Tom really needs, which is a funny byline since she's basically a 12-year-old with the maturity level of a 20-something.The movie might have ended on a very sour note, further depressing anyone watching. But, in the end, we're given a small ray of sunshine that drifts away from Summer and helps lift Tom into a new season. Perhaps Autumn will be better...

The quirky script, and rather original format is much more beguiling than the all too regular linear romantic tale.The story depicts the 500 days that Tom Hansen encounters Summer Finn and their ambiguous, unconventional and absorbing relationship. The film is partly narrated and gives 500 Days a rather comforting feel as though the Narrator is an all wise deity, indeed he inform us of the outcome of the film at the onset. The film thereafter is conveyed in a grounded but other worldly feel... If that makes sense.The relationship is brought whimsically and imaginatively to life by the almost random fluttering between the 500 days. The interchange between such days never becomes tiresome. The ups-and-downs are injected with life by two great young actors. Levitt plays Tom with aplomb, and provides a subtle coolness whilst conveying the almost touchable emotional angst. Summer is much the same as Tom rather a cool chick but remains rather evasive throughout. Deschanel providing a wonderful performance by producing an enchanting aura around Summer. There are some excellent moments in particular the 'Reality' and 'Expectations' scene, it is not only intriguing viewing but a raw depiction of human emotion provided in a refreshing way. The imaginative 'dance scene' conveying the joys of Tom Hansen as the first shoots of romance spring is aptly deft at providing his internal emotions. The film is intersperse with segments of music, which help glide the film along and resonate a certain connectivity to the emotions of Tom and Summer. One personal gripe was the Sweet Disposition track which plays frequently through the film. I just don't like the song.I did have a few problems with the film one being the idea that Tom's young sister can provide relationship advise. Although this is rather endearing it is too quirky and mis-directed. The film also ends rather gimmicky when Tom encounters a lady at a job interview. Lastly, the film brings a rather startlingly revelation near the end of the film concerning Summer, which seemed like a last minute afterthought and had an abruptness which I wasn't keen upon.500 Days of Summer is original, refreshing and excellently brought to life through the direction of Marc Webb, the novel screenplay and the great performances from Deschanel and Levitt. A film to be watched and admired for its well-structured and creative story.

Leads Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel don't begin the film as rivals/enemies and end it as lovers in the screwball fashion spurred by Tracy/Hepburn and company. They don't have a hot-cold romance that eventually falls through, in the Annie Hall tradition. In ""(500) Days,"" Gordon-Levitt's Tom falls head-over-heels in love with Zooey Deschanel's Summer. He doesn't have that Woody Allen ""devil may care"" attitude, where you doubt that the romance really means all that much to him. He is totally smitten. The wrench in the works is Summer. She's just not in love with Tom. Their relationship actually loses steam and fizzles out with Tom despairing and Summer.....well......feeling alright.This sounds like a spoiler review, but it's not. Part of the innovation of this film is its structure. Thanks to visual cues on screen, the film jumps from day to day, whether forward or backwards. The film opens at the end of the relationship, the jumps all throughout its 500 days. This keeps the narrative fresh and interesting, and doesn't allow the sadder scenes to sink the film into depression.This is THE romantic comedy for this generation. The characters are bitingly sarcastic and pop culturally-aware. Their conversations are compelling and witty, and their clothes have that undeniably ""hipster"" quality. They love ""vintage"" items, and they think.talk about profound subjects. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are perfectly cast. They play the leads with genuine humanity and interest.

Aren't you tired of all the movies these days with redundant music scores? The first thing I did after watching this, was go straight to research every single track on this movie. Regina Spektor and The Smith's made this piece of work complete. The Music is in perfect sync with every single scene! That is a very hard thing to achieve--to have perfect sound match the scene.The scene with Summer's rooftop party literally put daggers through my heart with Regina Spektor's ""Hero"" . You have to be heartless to watch that scene with out feeling like you are being dumped yourself.The Non-Linear Narrative style Webb and team used was a nice twist to see in a movie, cutting in and out from different days and so forth.The 1960's/modern-esque fashion is great to see, cast members wearing basic beige, navy, brown etc. And the music also matched the fashion very well too...Indie Rock songs with semi-formal/modern-esque/60's clothes is a great mix.**Now to the cutting edge** Although they say ""this is not a love story"" It IS indeed a love story. I think the filmmakers added that bit in there to give us some foreshadowing about how Tom became bitter through-out the movie.The cinematography was great, The camera's used were very smooth...you can tell smooth camera movement when your eyes DON'T jump all over the place...but smoothly transitioning is key..especially so you don't give your audience a headache like ""paranormal activity"" Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt were perfect for this movie as well, the music and fashion also fuse to their natural poise and personality...maybe a little bit more to Zooey.If I had to nit pick on something it would be the little sister who acts like an older person, that whole role just seemed awkward and forced.

(500) Days of Summer,151,Metal Angel Ehrler,11/Jan/10,10,6.49039560742325e-20,film movie one not story good comedy will even films time best can way life characters much love make just may movies director new never only see first also without people ever something real doesnt character feel year romantic kind action man audience really screen cinema far seen long right might plot,,,inf,inf,inf," It's always a thrill to watch romantic comedies, because they make us feel good about life generally and because they confirm our beliefs that love is very much alive and that it can happen to anyone...even if these movies ARE absolutely fictional and carry a plot line that's as believable as The Lord of the Rings taking place in New York. This year, however, director Marc Webb has astounded us with a TRULY refreshing romantic comedy called ""(500) Days of Summer"", which is by far THE most original romantic comedy of the year, and which is not only life-affirming but which also echoes true life and which has a ring and a taste of certainty that no other film of its genre has captured.The film follows Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a man who studied to be an architect but who is now suffocated in a greeting-card business that's not very motivating but which does give him easy money to earn. He's the kind of man who believes that love comes to you, that you immediately FEEL who you'll live with for the rest of your life when you meet that person. In just a few minutes, the film opens up the character of Tom in a very complete, methodical and empathic way, and by the end of these first minutes, we feel like we already know him completely and that we sympathize with whatever he'll do. Now, this likable man who believes in happily ever after meets Summer (Zooey Deschanel), an equally likable and charming girl who the audience instantly falls in love with. Despite her appealing demeanor and her irresistible personality, Summer refuses to believe in true love and is convinced that she will NEVER find a man with whom she'd like to live with, let alone marry...and like the tag-line of the movie says: ""Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't."" The story is as simple as they come, but the way it's told is fresh and a pure joy to watch. Tom goes through the 500 days he's known Summer, but he doesn't do so in chronological order; scenes go madly back and forth in time, from day 275 to day 43, to 470, to day 1 and etc. This might at first seem a bit too crazy, but I ask you, who can detail the entire story of a long relationship precisely from day 1 to the last? Usually you begin somewhere and, once you start telling the story, you come back to previous events that support something else you said, right? This style of storytelling enhances the feeling of the movie and gives it the sort of 'puzzle solving' characteristic of other films. Needless to say, each scene is infused with the charm and wit of both main characters, and the days of their relationship pass through our minds, and we feel like we can savor their emotions, like their words inject life and experience into our bloodstream.Summer is a wonderful girl, she really likes Tom and she's willing to be friends with him and to have an open relationship. But Tom falls in love with her every day more, she allows him to do so and we see their intimate relationship go to such depths where the only outcome could possibly be a Happy Ever After. Nevertheless their views on life and love are so different that the story always keeps us in suspense as to what the resolution may be. Tom is besotted with Summer, she refuses to give the relationship another go, and as both their views begin to clash so much, we're (the audience) sure that ANYTHING is possible. It IS a romantic comedy, but there's no way we can predict the outcome, even if it's as obvious as they come. THAT'S the wonder of the film, how it takes such a simple story and give it infinite depth and charisma to a point where you cannot help but wonder why you've never seen such a heartfelt affirmation of life and love on screen before.It's a film without a single cheesy moment or without exploiting a single clich Ã either. It's completely new, and the charm exuded by the characters doesn't remind us of any other cinema couple. On the contrary, they remind us of ourselves, of the people we know, of true stories we've heard before. When we see them going into a karaoke bar in the movie, or when they meet at the park for a picnic, the situation, the dialogue, and the action are so REAL, so natural and so touching that you can't help but feel you know the characters personally. In a very silent and straightforward way the film engrosses you.The editing is perfect, and there's just no other order to the scenes. Change the sequence of one scene with the next and the film would lose its power. The cinematography is remarkable- with a particular scene where Tom and Summer are walking and he's showing her his favorite buildings- this scene is grandiose. And there's even a Broadway-style musical number which is totally adequate, complete with a choreography and animated bluebirds  Ã¸ la Song of the South; there's another poignant scene that's split-screen with a dream event occurring in one side and the dark truth happening on the other; there's also interview scenes where other characters give their opinions on the topic of love. The film is all-inclusive where photographic techniques are involved, and it gives the screenplay a playful and cheery quality which mesmerizes us.This film was sent from romantic comedy heaven, and it's one of the surprise best films of the year. It's sure to carve its notch among the best films of its genre ever. Go see it now!

(500) Days of Summer,152,diac228 (diac1987@netscape.net),09/Jan/10,9,2.892048109618063e-19,film movie one not story comedy well funny even films time best can way life characters much love make just work director little look fun new never great two only see first heart also old ever something big real tale often doesnt romantic audience better works seen hollywood right music dont,,,inf,inf,inf," I was angry at the characters. I was angry at the way the story was progressing. I was angry because I knew of the gloom and doom that was approaching. I was angry, because, I had been there, experienced that all before. I was angry because I didn't want to see it happen to someone else. That's exactly why 500 Days of Summer works as a heart-wrenching, soul-slamming romantic dramedy. This film is realistic, funny, charming, bubbly, and just a fantastic example of superb low-budget directing complimenting the low-budget writing. The movie is also utterly realistic and cleverly original, and becomes one of the better films of 2009.In this soul-draining non-love story, we follow Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as he tries to pick up the pieces of his broken heart and figure out why his on-off girlfriend (Zooey Deschanel) does not ultimately return the undeniable love he has for her. The film goes in a totally non-linear format, resembling the jumbled-yet-well-structured storytelling style of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. 500 Days of Summer never just presents the story either, there is a song-and-dance routine, a few documentary-like scenes, and even an extremely clever split-screen moment that has the expectations of Tom, and the actual reality that results. Bitterly written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, it's obvious they brought personal experiences to the table. Only real life can craft such cruel moments.Chemistry is what can make or break a romantic comedy. In this case, it's not only adorable and sensual, but it's downright real to the core. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel deserve acting nominations for their work, because the chemistry they had together oozes all over the film in ways not seen often in the last decade. They are not two big major stars with epic looks falling for each other, they are down-to-earth individuals that became caught up in an awkward relationship, and their sensible mannerisms enhanced the charm and realism of the entire production. Zooey Deschanel doesn't have the Hollywood look, but her portrayal of Summer pretty much forces you to fall for her just as bad as Tom does.Marc Webb, a somewhat-accomplished music video director, absolutely excels in his first feature film. He takes all the little quirks and fun techniques that are usually employed to short music videos, and sprinkles them all over the 95 minutes of seeing a relationship rise and fall. Just like Michael Gondry and Spike Jonze, the music video experience allows for him to think outside the box in presenting a cinematic story, resulting in a very original experience in terms of visuals. The best example of great direction in this movie is the superb expectation/reality sequence halfway in. And just like Jonze and Gondry, he can also catch emotion and heartbreak just as well as the most experienced. You are smiling when they are at their best, and on the verge of an emotional breakdown when you see them are their lowest. And with the roller coaster-like structure, the audience is never allowed to remain too happy or too sad for too long.The narrator in the film from the very beginning warns that it is not a love tale. This couldn't be any closer to the truth. It's a gut-wrenching story, and it is a tale that we all experience. Finding what we think is The One, only to see her (or him) slipping away in favor of someone else. And like I said before (in a subtle manner), this movie avoids the Hollywood clich Ãs and does deliver on its hurtful promises. You don't see a happy ending in the distance, yet yearn for one.Where the movie hits the toughest note is the third act. For a movie that takes its time in presenting the highs and lows of the relationship, we are left with a very empty conclusion. Not all the questions were answered, and not all is explained. In a film that runs so deep in the beginning, it's rather disappointing to hit shallow waters towards the end. But maybe this is the intention. Are we ever meant to truly understand why something doesn't work? Are there cases in which there is no explanation, it's just that the relationship just never ""clicked?"" Can we ever truly learn from a failed relationship that has an abrupt ending? Just like Tom and Summer in the beginning of the movie, our connection with the film and the relationship suddenly gets cut off with no explanation, leading to an ending that rushes right in. Maybe it is our personal duty to dwell, to learn, to figure it out, and to move on with the knowledge intact. I never see myself being satisfied at an abrupt ending (See: No Country For Old Men), but 500 Days of Summer gets the pass because the film itself is such a satisfying and practical representation of our relationships with people__even when we are not ready for the end.Bottom Line: 500 Days of Summer is a beautiful film, no doubt about it. It's a brutally realistic story and an overall overwhelmingly charming experience that takes us through the highs and lows in life when sharing them with that current special someone. Besides the questionable ending, this movie has very few flaws thanks to excellent direction, excellent chemistry, and writing that sting the heartstrings like needles. If you are trying to mend new (or old) wounds (*raises hand*), this is the right film to watch to begin (or continue) the healing process. This film is not a love story, but it is indeed a story to fall in love with. Highly recommend.

Entertaining because it managed to combine witty humour with a story-line that audiences could both relate and fall in love with. And revolutionary because it took us on an all too familiar romantic ride in a non-linear fashion that allowed it to seem like something we had never seen before. Cinematically the movie is beautiful. Whether it be the use of a split screen, a transition into a sketch, or a dated film, every scene managed to captivate me in a new way. And it managed to do all of this without getting itself classified as one of those 'artistic' films best enjoyed by only a specific audience. Performance wise the movie was once again incredible. There is no denying that it was a bold move to cast both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as the leads in this film. Despite both having a credible history of films, neither had been given the opportunity to carry a film like they had to in (500) Days of Summer. Given this deserved opportunity, they both flourished. Joseph managed to create a character that was both easily relatable for the male audience, and innocently attractive to female viewers. Zooey, like Joseph, gave a performance filled with such realism, that viewers automatically found themselves in love with Summer Finn. In summation, (500) Days of Summer was one of the most inspirational films I have seen in quite some time, and it came from a genre I thought inspiration was not possible in - romance. If you have not seen it yet, I recommend you take the time to see this film, as every element of it, right down to its soundtrack will captivate you.

Following a typical clich Ã that combines with an uninteresting tale of boy meets girl or the other way around that is overused and uninteresting. However, what separates this film with other romantic stories is the realistic take of a boy meets girl and presents this in a manner where even a guy like me can enjoy. While this movie is not exactly a break-up film or the typical romantic comedy film, I really liked the story of this film. As said earlier, It is a simple boy meets girl that portrays this in a realistic manner that shows the highs of being in a relationship and the lows of being dumped or separated from your love. What helped boost the story and fascinating was the storytelling. In easier terms, the film presents a yin-yang type of storytelling; one moment you will see Tom filled with joy and enjoying life as he is with Summer, then the story will jump to a different time where Tom is depressed, then the film repeats this process. Watching this is never annoying and succeeds in telling a good story, making it compelling. Every actor and actress were perfectly well casted and portrayed their characters very well. Every character, especially the minor characters have at least something funny to present. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom and Zooey Deschanel as Summer were great. You can definitely buy the chemistry between these two as you watch their relationship bloom as they are together. I like the fact that the director didn't make Tom the ultimate good guy, making you question his actions that led him to this situation. The beginning will make you think that Summer is evil, but as you watch the film, you begin to realize the flaws and mistakes that Tom had made and will understand the reason of the breakup. What surprised me most about the movie was the humor since I found myself laughing throughout various moments in the film. There are conversations, interactions and dialogue between the characters that succeeds in bringing laughter to anyone who enjoys the plot. Although you do not see them a lot, personally, Tom's friends really helped bring the humor to some scenes. They were never annoying, didn't outshine any of the cast and were great as you see them on screen. Their conversations really reminds me of my discussion with my best friend that leads up to answers and conclusions that is similar to what these characters say in the film; may sound weird, but it worked for me. In the end, I ended up liking this film more than I expected. Bringing a realistic take on romance and to present it with good humor, great acting and likable characters really made this film fun to watch.

Basically Tom Hansen (Inception's Golden Globe nominated Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has recently broken up with Summer Finn (Yes Man's Zooey Deschanel), and the film is a backwards-forward various order charts their relationship. Tom trained as an architect, but works making greeting cards, and Summer was the new assistant to his boss, and it was Tom's friend and co-worker McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) who helped set them up and start dating. Over the next few months they got closer, but obviously the film being so mixed with ordering of their love there are the moments that show how they started breaking apart as well. Summer did not originally believe that true love existed, and Tom fell over heels for her, and after just over two hundred days together their first argument comes from a bout of jealousy. They do eventually break up, Tom finds it hard to take and has depression, and Summer quits her job to move on, but they see each other again at a co-worker's wedding, and she is surprised to catch the bouquet. They start to become friends again, but he is devastated to see that she is wearing an engagement ring, and after a long bout of deeper depression, scoffing on junk food and alcoholism, he has an outburst at work, and quits. A long time passes, and Tom and Summer see each other again at his favourite spot on the park bench, and they really talk things through, they make up with each other before going their separate ways. So in the end Summer did find true love, just with someone else, even though she did have a lovely relationship with Tom, and he meanwhile twelve days later finds a new girl to ask on a date, her name is Autumn (Minka Kelly). Also starring Kick-Ass's Chlo Ã Grace Moretz as Rachel, Matthew Gray Gubler as Paul, Clark Gregg as Vance, Patricia Belcher as Millie and Rachel Boston as Alison. Gordon-Levitt is a good looking likable guy, and Deschanel is as usual is beautiful, kooky and lovable, you could think of this film as a faster paced and softer Pulp Fiction or Memento with this style of editing, it does make for some interesting scenes, it may confuse you a little bit, but actually doing it the regular order would be a bit boring, so all in all it is a good fun and nice alternative romantic comedy.

Mostly because I don't know what to write about and how much to leave for you to find out. Anyway, I will give it a try simply because this is an amazing movie and shockingly few people have even heard about it. I feel morally obligated to do this! Synopsis : Tom Hansen, played by JGL, is a greeting card writer and is convinced that there is a difference between believing in true love and Santa Claus. Summer Finn, played by Zooey, joins the greeting card company and hits it off with Tom. In between songs performed by Simon & Garfunkel, The Smiths, Regina Spektor and even Carla Bruni, Tom lives through 500 days, some with and some without Summer. No spoilers here since the film's tagline itself reads out, ""Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl Doesn't"".What's Good : Right during the film's opening, the narrator sets up the intrigue by clarifying, ""This is a movie about Boy meets Girl. But you should know upfront __ this is not a love story."" The movie does not always move in chronological order, which is a very clever screenplay device for portraying pre and post-Summer Tom. The leads are charming and very convincing as twenty-somethings not sure of what they're looking for in life, or love. Their characters are disarmingly likable, have their endearing quirks __ and I will go out on a limb and say that its impossible to not fall in love with them. Also of note is the music featured throughout the movie __ mostly 60s and 70s British pop but also newer, little known bands like Mumm-Ra, Doves and Temper Trap. Oh and there's also an amazingly choreographed little dance number on JGL.Whats not : Tom's younger sister, played by, Chloe Grace Moretz plays on the wise-beyond-her-years clich Ã for far too long.There are many things unique to this movie. This, to me, was the most humorous movie of the last 5 years and yet it didn't seem forced like The Hangover. And yet, before the climax its hard to not feel for Tom. There are also a couple of scenes (one being ""expectations v/s reality"") which portray things each one of us goes through everyday and its amazing how well its been played out in the movie.It has a lot of similarities with High Fidelity (break-up movie, 70s music, hero is interested in architecture etc), which is another stupendous rom-com but this one's more grown-up and subtle.Verdict : You will either really like it or you may really hate it :) My Rating : 10/10 "," Reviewing  favorite movie   time  insanely challenging.

It works, to a certain degree, especially thanks to two very effective leads. Having had my own little celebrity-crush on Zooey Deschanel ever since her short but unforgettable performance in Almost Famous almost a decade ago, it was easy to relate to the character portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who's growing up to be quite a decent actor by his own right, even if he still looks sixteen (I was hoping to see some stubble in the scene in which he's depressed and doesn't leave his bed for a week, but nada).500 Days of Summer has a lot going for it, and a lot of the right elements are in place, but it doesn't achieve real greatness, not even mild and humble greatness like that of solid, intelligent romantic comedies (Jerry Maguire, When Harry Met Sally, High Fidelity etc.) It's just not that memorable, and stylistic elements like the non-linear storytelling serve mainly the purpose of being cool and contemporary than any real one. And even though the actors are great and they do their best, they do it with characters that aren't very complex to begin with. It's an enjoyable movie, and a fantastic date-movie for a couple of young cynics, but it's not one that will stick with you for long.

I came into watching the film with no expectations, and expecting another cheesy, flimsy romantic comedy but got so much more... The film structures by skipping through the days of a couple's relationship. You get to see the start, the happy days of their relationship, and when the feelings start to fade. You also get to see the most depressing parts, the aftermath. The interesting part is that the film doesn't move around in chronological order, it skips around to the most important parts. I loved this, and it added to the uniqueness of the film. The acting in this film was unbelievable. Joseph Levitt is a fantastic actor, playing roles in 50/50 and Hesher. He surprises us in each role, but this one captures realism more than others. The most surprising was probably Zooey Deschanel 's acting. She is a witty girl, playing a role in the new hit show New Girl, and I never suspected real acting from her. But she plays a realistic approach without overdoing it like most other actors. The supporting cast was great too, and I had no criticism in this department... The screenplay was actually handed really well. The humor was not laugh-out-loud funny, but it was actually real. The jokes and stuff were funny, but in a witty kind of way. They are fast-paced and keep coming, just like real life... That leads me to the next part, how REAL this is. I think the film is better if you have experienced this situation before. Summer is a realistic approach of a girl who isn't looking for commitment, but then backfires on you. It makes you feel depressed and betrayed, but it happens. The thing that makes the film unique(r) is the fact is displays Tom's feelings so real. I was believing I was in his situation, and that makes a great film. I think the tag-line completes the film, as the movie really isn't the clich Ã, sappy movie it looks out to be. It's unique, real, and touching, and I recommend it for all. 10/10.

I can't say it's my favourite romantic film, but it would probably make a top ten. But I digress, here's a bit about the plot first.Tom Hansen is working for a greetings card company when Summer Finn starts to work there. He is, of course, attracted to her but is afraid to make the first move. His friends, McKenzie and Paul, persuade him to talk to her at a karaoke night and one thing leads to another. She tells him that she does not want a boyfriend and he agrees to just keep it light. But as time passes, it's clear that Tom is struggling not knowing where he is with her. He even asks advice from his street-wise little sister, Rachel. It seems the relationship is doomed when Summer leaves her job, and also Tom. He is heartbroken, but they are destined to meet again__ more than once.The story is told in a rather unusual way; we start near the end of the 500 days and then jump back to the beginning. This continues throughout the film which meant the audience has to keep watching or they could get easily lost. I found it a different and refreshing way to put the narrative on the screen. Decent performances all round, so honourable mentions go to; Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom Hansen, Zooey Deschanel as Summer Finn, Geoffrey Arend as McKenzie, Chloe Moretz as Rachel Hansen and Matthew Gray Gubler as Paul.There are a lot of comparisons I can draw with other films; for instance, the character of Summer reminded me very much of Holly Golightly from Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961). There is a musical number performed in the street featuring Tom that could be from any musical you could name. At the end of the day I found it a very entertaining film, although Summer was a little irritating at times. But forgiving that, it's pretty much recommended.My score: 7.9/10 "," Deep down   bit   romantic   burned  time  several     nice  find  film  .  not  usual 'boy meets girl __  fall  love  live happily ever ' type  tale, no,  much  realistic  that__    large dose  quirkiness thrown .  can't say   favourite romantic film,    probably make  top ten.   digress,   bit   plot first.Tom Hansen  working   greetings card company  Summer Finn starts  work .  ,  course, attracted     afraid  make  first move.  friends, McKenzie  Paul, persuade   talk     karaoke night  one thing leads  .  tells     not want  boyfriend   agrees  just keep  light.   time passes,  clear  Tom  struggling not knowing     .  even asks advice   street-wise little sister, Rachel.  seems  relationship  doomed  Summer leaves  job,  also Tom.   heartbroken,    destined  meet again__   once.The story  told   rather unusual way   start   end   500 days   jump back   beginning.  continues throughout  film  meant  audience   keep watching    get easily lost.  found   different  refreshing way  put  narrative   screen.

(500) Days of Summer,168,MBunge,17/Sep/10,7,3.5630182538621193e-10,film movie one not story good comedy time life love just makes little still never great see heart also old many ever something tale humor doesnt character romantic kind get really isnt,0.5,2.0,inf,inf,inf," This movie is a black comedy where all the darkness has been sucked out and replaced with a creamy filling of Zooey Deschanel. It's a brutally heartbreaking tale told with whimsy and wry appreciation.One of those stories where the guy acts like the girl and the girl acts like the guy, (500) Days of Summer is about all the time Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) found himself in love with Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel). He's a failed architect who now makes a living writing greeting cards. She's cute and smart and quirky and seems like the perfect girl Tom has been waiting his whole life to love. The problem is Summer hasn't been waiting her whole life to love anyone, especially Tom. She tells Tom up front that she doesn't believe in love and isn't interested in anything serious. As the movie jumps back and forth among the end, beginning and middle of their relationship, we see what happens when one person thinks they've found their soulmate and the other just thinks they've found a buddy. When Summer tires of indulging Tom's romantic pretensions, he's crushed flatter than a piece of chewing gum run over by the bulls of Pamplona and it's not at all clear if the story's going to end with Tom getting over Summer, getting her back or killing himself.If you've ever been in one of those ""I love you more than you love me"" relationships, you know how painful they cab be. Watching that sort of thing in this movie, however, is a very pleasant experience. Part of that is the delightful Miss Deschanel. Most of it comes from these filmmakers recognizing that the bad guy in this story isn't Summer, it's Tom. (500) Days of Summer isn't about a good guy who gets his heart stomped on by some unfeeling bitch. This is about a guy who still clings to immature fantasies about love and his life and what it finally takes for him to grow up. You could think of this film as a less contrived and more relaxed version of Forgetting Sarah Marshall where the humor comes from understanding how many of Tom's problems are his own doing.Miss Deschanel is lovely as the somewhat opaque Summer. We never get to see inside her character, but that's kind of the point. Tom never really sees her either, just how the idea of her fits in with his fantasy of love. Joseph Gordon-Levitt also excels in a tougher role than you'd expect. He never really gets to play the sympathetic victim because Tom isn't that sympathetic. While it shows Summer being a bit emotionally insensitive, the story never wavers from Tom's own responsibility for his situation.With some comic relief from Tom's friends and his little sister, a great dance number and a nice soundtrack, (500) Days of Summer is a sweet little confection of a film. It does end on a moral that doesn't fit the rest of the story and it is very lightweight, but if you're looking for something to help you realize that maybe that old girlfriend isn't actually to blame for your life falling apart, I believe you'll quite enjoy it.

This film is sweet but tragic. It's endearing and real. The characters are treated like real people with real complex philosophical attractions to things like fate and destiny. It's always disappointing to watch a film of the same genre following its characters as they go through the motions to an ending that insults us and is preordained. In this case the film starts at the end and we see how these two people break up. And we are given insight through a series of flashbacks so we can piece together how the puzzle fell apart. Joseph Gordon Levitt plays it straight and charming. He's not unsure of himself and bumbling like other characters we have seen in similar roles. He's natural and easy to like. Zooey Deschanel also is wonderful in her performance and I have met girls like this before. Each bring their own foibles to the relationship. Both strength and weakness. There's a wonderful dance sequence with an old Hall and Oats song and the film has fun with it's narrations and observations. What a remarkable film and a great study of modern relationships.

Before watching the film, I cannot stop thinking that what makes this highly-praised indie film of 2009 so unique as its synopsis sounds really banal. Nevertheless after I finish the film, I do love it from the bottom of my heart and it turns out quite educational for most lovers as well. In order to make this ultra-predictable story more delicious and attractive, director Marc Webb has offered us multiple levels of distractions, including the whole random narrative order, the reality/expectation split-screen shots and even animations, which shows that the team behind do esteem their audiences. I think it is also an important reason why Marc has been selected as the director of the upcoming Spider Man IV, as he knows very well how to please the audience and respect them at the same time.Also the success of this film is largely owing to two protagonists' wonderful performances, especially for Joseph, I would give him an Oscar nomination if I was could, unfortunately the Academy members generally overlook this kind of light films. The chemistry between Joseph and Zooey are amazing and sincere, as if they just revert themselves to their authentic lives, sometimes the effect is heartrending, which was like a mirror, everyone could see himself/herself through the film.One of my recurring argument is that it is very difficult to find a great script nowadays, which doesn't mean one could not be able to shoot a great film, ""(500) Days of Summer"" is a perfect example, even with a totally mundane story with a suspense-free script, if only one is conscientious and determined, he still can make a film unique and enjoyable, I think the esteem towards the massive audience is the main factor, which barely can be found in most of recent films.

How inconsistent, artificial, and non-relatable those pieces of drivel are. Take two A-list actors, a mammoth of a budget, heavy advertising, an A-list actor, and Hollywood automatically thinks those aspects make a decent film. Films these days have fallen so short of substance because of the unappealing character development, the paint-by-numbers plot, and the predictability level is off the charts. Shoot, even mentioning the aforementioned ways of Hollywood is already clich Ã and by-the-numbers in itself. Albeit, (500) Days of Summer is so shockingly realistic, that one may seem to think that in reality, one such romance would never end on such a hard punch to the abdomen. One would also predict that the film would come off as a pretentious, over-the-top mess that screams ""desperate"", just to appeal to the hipster crowd. Fortunately, (500) Days of Summer is so overbearingly real that it is a thousand times more relatable than any other romantic comedy you've ever seen. Also, how it manages to side skirt every ""chick flick"" clich Ã and comes off as anti-pretentious, is just remarkable. (500) Days of Summer is not just the best romantic comedy you'll ever see, but probably one of the best movies you'll see in the last five years.(500) Days of Summer revolves around Tom (Levitt) who's outright admiration goes to Summer (Deschanel). Summer is like a pin point on a map that takes Tom's life to another adventure. Fortunately, Summer is Tom's ""luck-be-lady-tonight"" , although, things don't go as planned. Summer gives Tom a lecture on love and how artificial it is. How ""love"" is just a textbook topic that is a gimmick. However, Tom sees love in a different light and thinks it's a beautiful treasure. Albeit, Summer thinks Tom as a friend with benefits, while Tom thinks he has a bright future with Summer. Will the spotlight be panned on Tom or Summer?The one of the many things that makes (500) Days of Summer play out like a commentary on life rather than a quick-buck cop-out, is the script. Just the dialog puts emphasis on how brutally honest this film is. The words the characters blurt out and the situations the characters encounter, is like a prime example of a documentary. Furthermore, the characters are just phenomenal. Their performances are so strong and realistic, it's like the viewer's life is projected onto the screen. To top it off, the film, stylistically, is a blast. The director uses a few tricks that are up his sleeves like the split screen. The film has a very ""indie"" feel to it. What's the icing on the cake, is the direction. This movie could have gone the inane and complete slap-in-the-face route, but it took the road less traveled by. Additionally, the soundtrack is just awe-inspiring. There's no clich Ã love songs or any mainstream sell-outs. Every music piece hits strong like a dodge ball does at a prepubescent kid in P.E. To add to that, the pacing is also flawless. No scenes feel tedious or too abrupt. Everything moves by at a rather smooth pace.You know the times, whether prepubescent or adulthood, where a man has had a dream girl and thinks everything is going to be pinpointed on a map right in front of his face, although, things take a turn for the worst? (500) Days of Summer demonstrates the cold truth. The performances are raw, the script is rich with reality, and the direction is bold. This is what filmmakers should be doing. Instead, most romantic comedy directors are stuck in their sandbox love memories tinkering with their fantasy world, rather than reaching for the truth tinkering with reality. (500) Days of Summer is definitely a copy and paste of the average person's life, but I mean that in the greatest way. If there's only one romantic comedy you'll see this year, make sure it's this one.

The cast puts on a pure heartfelt down-to-earth expression about the modernisms of relationships and how it is biased from the two people in one. We have the great and charismatic Joseph Gordon-Levitt who plays 'Tom' (3rd Rock from the Sun, Brick, INCEPTION) who wholly represents the hopefully romantic and perhaps foolish romantic who wants that one great person in his life. He has a lovable geeky mannerism with no time for circumlocution, no time for one-night- stands or other quick endeavours. He rages through all the typical energies of love, angst, hope, determination. His yin to his coherent yang is Zoe Deschanel's character 'Summer' who has an aura of melancholy and nostalgia of previous non-standing relationship surrounding her, whilst JGL's character tries affectionately to break her hard-shell prejudices of there being ""no such thing as love"". There is a level of emotional climax found throughout, but it is up to the audience to find it. It has a the feeling of a warm afternoon summer breeze which starts to fade away into the autumnal currents. Then rise back to warmer weathers only to be pushed back into cold winter gusts.All throughout you want Summer (Z. Deschanel) to *see* love in Tom (J. G-L), but the ending, like most Hollywood films end on, is bitter-sweet. It gives a lasting impression of hope, like a gasp of cheer. With a send off like a pat on the back, feeling fresh. As a film you try to expect where the plot will go and if she will see Tom for what he genuinely is, a guy very much in love with every bit of Summer. You walk out with a glassful of hope in one hand and joy in the other.The most feel-good film of 2009 I reckon. Effortless to enjoy, like a wisp of sugar and smooth like Nutella. 8.5/10.

Every character, whether it be Gordon-Levitt's embarrassing drunk workmate or the quirky, totally unpredictable Summer herself, feels utterly authentic and any viewer should be able to relate back to the people they know. As well as a stand-out performance from Gordon-Levitt, the movie also offers a number of the year's most memorable and unique scenes.

The movie doesn't aim for the sky and maybe it doesn't need to. It's a simple tale which is well told. Perhaps the most striking feature of this movie is its unconventional approach. The acting is consistent with the overall tone of the movie. No histrionics demanded, no histrionics delivered is the way i'd put it. The soundtrack is refreshing. The direction is adequate. What stands out however is the screenplay of the film. At a running time of just over 90 minutes, the editing is crisp. The fact that it does not take itself too seriously is its biggest advantage since that is precisely what makes it an easy watch. The movie might not feature in the list of 'top 100 movies' or 'movies you must watch before you die' but it's a nice way to spend a not-so-busy evening.

There are also some various techniques employed to make the film a little different: There is the drawing of the park with has the number counter, although the clacking noise used really grated my nerves. I liked the 'fantasy' sequences, the one where Tom dances his way to work was great. Also the scene where the picture changes to a drawing. Another technique used was a split screen to portray the real and fantasy events of when Tom sees Summer at a party after they have broken up.

Summer is a vintage-looking beauty whose ideas about love are entirely modern. As Tom remembers his 500 days with Summer, his mind jumps from moment to moment, largely thinking of the good times in their trouble-filled relationship.""This is a boy meets girl story, but it is not a love story."" As the opening lines of the film suggests, this is not your average romantic comedy and while that doesn't always mean it's a good thing, in this case, it is. Because of this, 500 DAYS OF SUMMER is one of the best movies of 2009. Not only is this a unique romantic comedy, but the way it tells its story is so ingenious and creative, that it makes this film one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. I loved it that much.Sometimes, if a film has this really awesome and original idea, it ends up failing because of the way it's handled. However, it seems as if director Marc Webb used his music video side of him to his advantage to create something magical and enchanting. Every song used in this film is so perfect for the scenes they are used in that it puts Quentin Tarantino himself to shame. Webb also uses another technique used in many Tarantino films: The nonlinear narrative. And it works!Another thing that works in this film is the two amazing leads: Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. Gordon-Levitt is an actor I praised before in BRICK. He also starred in another fantastic film, THE LOOKOUT. Now, about two years later, he's better than ever, playing the charismatic leading man! Zooey Deschanel plays Gordon's love interest and she's as great as usual. I love her in anything she's in. Another person I would like to mention is Chloe Moretz. I personally found her to be my favorite character because she's flat out hilarious.If you know me, you'd know I love movies about love. I especially love the tragic ones as well as the clich Ãd ones. Even though 500 DAYS OF SUMMER isn't either one of those, I was bound to love it. The film is both very funny and sweet. It's supports a great cast, a quirky and brilliant script, a unique style, and a director who has a bright future ahead of him. For those who love romantic comedies and those who have given up on them, 500 DAYS OF SUMMER is a film everyone should see once in their lifetime.

How many times does a girl need to say I'm not in love with you for you to get the message? If you're a teenager it's understandable, but not as an adult! The fact that the characters write greeting card is silly -- conveniently it allows the characters to express the way they're really feeling. This is how everyone knows how Tom himself really feels. At least we now know who these people are who get paid well to write a few lines of clich Ãs a month.The good: The acting is good -- Joseph Gordon-Levitt is convincing as the boy with the crush, and it is easy to like him because he remains faithful to his feelings. I also like that he is able to effectively display his feelings. His charm on the screen makes the plot seem richer than it is.Zooey is also believable, although I would expect her to have rejected Tom early and put even more distance between them. She has a strong screen presence, and plays a good ""too good to fall in love"" character.I do like the idea of flipping the days around, but sadly I think this is necessary to keep the plot from being boring. The other redeeming thing was that Summer didn't leave her husband at the end.The production is polished, the editing and photography are well done, and I do like the random LA scenes which are easily identifiable -- eg the Ahmanson theatre and downtown overlooks which are good settings for the moods the film tries to make.Summary: Overall this film is a slick production, but way too predictable.

Yes, the odd rom-com can be fresh and interesting but I often find them to be reasonably unoriginal and a little clich Ãd. (500) Days of Summer couldn't be further from the average rom-com.The film twists the stereotypical ""boy meets girl"" rom-com love story formula on its head, in this case, boy meets girl who doesn't believe in love.

But, for the record, it seems to me this is more of a ""coming-of-age"" story than a love story. Perhaps I just have yet to accept Mr. Gordon-Levitt as an adult. (He was 26 when this film was in production and still appears so damn youthful.) Whatever... he delivers a near-perfect performance as the wanna-be architect turned greeting card designer. (Makes sense in this current economy.) Falling in love with co-worker, Summer, the screenplay bounces back and forth over a 500-day period of their friendship/love story mainly from Tom's (Gordon-Levitt) point of view. Summer Finn's intense self-center absorption captivates Tom to near crazed, self-destructiveness. Ms. Zooey Dechannel's portrayal is good, but most scenes are carried by Gordon-Levitt. I imagine the part of Summer being played better by a score of actresses and perhaps the director intended this rather uneven pairing.I think many of us will identify with these characters. The rather young, lost, soul-searching young male falling for the girl/woman ""wild-child"" beauty of a Summer Finn. Most likely during a college romance - not in one's mid-20's - but our world is an ever changing social order.

(500) Days of Summer,187,ciao77,27/Dec/09,7,7.500376527483951e-14,film movie one not story good comedy will even films way much love just makes may director little enough new only see first made also performance though cast without many something real years character feel romantic get better really long isnt right music dont moments plot,0.5,2.0,inf,inf,inf," When I first saw the trailer for 500 Days of Summer, I could not wait to see it. It seemed like a unique, refreshingly real film; something new to offer to the romantic comedy genre, which has gone WAY downhill in the last 20-30 years. I feel like our expectations of what a really good movie should entail have also gone down, probably because there's so much rubbish out there, that even a film that is slightly creative (such as this), will get more merit than it truly deserves (that's my opinion). I have read several positive reviews of 500 Days of Summer, from different sites; most reviews agree that the directing, sequence of events, plot, etc., are original (especially the non-conventional love story) and that the cast is talented. Some more critical reviews mention that the film is not nearly as unique and original as it is made out to be, that the story is, in fact, predictable; something it sets out NOT to do. 500 Days of Summer takes you on a ride through the main character, Tom's, memory..err, fragments of memory, of his relationship with Summer. He falls in love with her, she does not want a serious relationship from the start, he is more serious about the relationship, she dumps him. He falls into a temporary post-breakup depression, he tries to see what went wrong. He learns that love and relationships are not guided by fate and happily-ever-after, and then he meets ""the one,"" who, surprise-surprise, is named after a different season. What I don't get, is how the relationship, so superficial, come to think of it, even lasted as long as it did. I guess 500 Days of Summer just sounds better than the more realistic, 90 Days of Summer. Anyway, this summary seems like it does not even scratch the surface, but believe me, it does more than just that; it's the film in a nutshell. Pepper it with some French film noir-type things (original, huh), some British pop/rock music, The Smiths, The Clash.., some hipster type clothing, a couple of karaoke scenes, a nice park atop a hill (which cannot be so beautiful in reality), and you've got 500 Days of Summer. It is not nearly as original as an independent or many foreign films; it simply lacks depth and creativity. Granted, there are some wonderful moments of...originality. Unfortunately, it seems to be overshadowed by the clich Ã. It was refreshing to actually be able to relate to the main character, Tom, but I feel like the film could have been delivered differently. I was entertained, but was not as enmeshed with the story/characters as I would have expected, and liked. Gordon-Levitt's performance is impeccable, however. He delivers- it is almost as though the entire film was based on his own personal experiences; he makes it so believable. He is one very talented actor (no prodigy or method actor like DeNiro or Nicholson, but he isn't really meant to be either). He is a very talented young actor, nonetheless, and I feel like this film will propel his career and allow him to develop his talent as an actor.As for the film as a whole, however, I am critical for a reason. Watch it for yourself, if you haven't. At the very least, you will be entertained. I enjoyed this movie, but found myself bored with it too. I feel like the director tried to hard to prove how different this movie is- how fresh, unique, and upbeat it is, that he perhaps overdid it. I feel like directors should just do whatever feels right, without much regard to how it may be perceived. True art, in my opinion, only comes from thinking outside the box, and staying true to one's passion/creativity. Although 500 Days of Summer pushes the envelope a little, it isn't enough for it to be entirely different. Not a horrible film, but in my opinion, nothing special either.

Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't."". Starting with the tag-line, it was clear that (500) Days of Summer wasn't going to be a typical romantic comedy. In fact, this film stands out as one of the rare genuine shots in the arm said genre so desperately needs, and that it succeeds is largely due to one thing: it's not really that romantic.As the film's co-writer Michael Weber pointed out when the film was shown at the 2009 Locarno Film Festival (on the opening night, no less), the screenplay is ""loosely"" based on something that happened to his creative partner Scott Neustadter - something that is hilariously mentioned right before the opening credits (a brilliant spin on the familiar ""any resemblance with real events is coincidental"" caption). Not that the information is essential in order to enjoy the story of Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an aspiring architect who writes greeting cards for a living, and Summer (Zooey Deschanel), his boss's new secretary. Tom falls for her immediately, whereas she doesn't believe in true love. Despite that jarring contrast, the two actually end up together, although Summer's ""allergy"" to commitment is likely to cause problems...So far, so predictable, right? How fortunate, then, that first-time director Marc Webb, aided by the writers, has decided to tell the story in non-linear fashion: the movie begins right after the break-up, and what happened before (and after) is reconstructed over the following 90 minutes. The aim is allegedly to play on the non-linearity of memory (the script jumps from day 1 to 300 or something), which allows the filmmakers to have a lot of fun movie-wise, thanks to clever editing - Tom entering an elevator happy and leaving heartbroken - and genre mixing, with the couple's conflicting views allowing for mental digressions that range from classic musicals to, of all people, Ingmar Bergman (the last time he got mentioned in a comedy was due to Woody Allen). Also, given Webb's music video pedigree, the soundtrack is very good and, unusually for a rom-com, devoid of sloppy sentiment (hello, Richard Curtis).The other winning factor in the film is the combination of dialogue, which is smart yet real, and performances, specifically the two leads: no offense to the fine supporting cast (Clark Gregg, Chloe Moretz, Criminal Minds' Matthew Gray Gubler), but the movie wouldn't be half as charming if it weren't for Gordon-Levitt, funny and vulnerable in equal measure, and the lovely Deschanel, who gracefully charms, laughs and sings her way through the entire film. Ironically, considering the film's plot, they are a perfect couple.(500) Days of Summer is a little film that can, and will, entertain and move audiences everywhere. It's a romantic comedy that intelligently subverts or avoids most of the genre's clich Ãs (including the romance) without ever coming off as a smug or cynical exercise in style. It also manages to overcome the ""I know how it's gonna end"" obstacle beautifully, with what is arguably one of the year's best closing lines. What's not to love? "," ""Boy meets girl.

Sure, the premise seems normal enough, but it manages to present itself in a different light, something that's fun to watch and at the same time actually something you can relate to.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is pretty convincing as Tom, the love-struck protagonist of the tale. The always adorable Zooey Deschanel plays Summer, his love interest who just wants their relationship to be ""casual."" Watching their times together is like a trip down memory lane, proving that a lot can happen in 500 days, some you would want to keep on remembering while others you would rather bury.I do not know much about the director Marc Webb, but seeing 500 Days of Summer has made me a believer. He uses a lot of techniques to flesh out certain ideas (the dance number in the park was a delight to see) or emphasize situations (that Expectation and Reality bit was ingenious) that normally would have been just treated as just another scene. These contributions make the film very engaging, somehow doing better than the special effects commonly found in action pieces.All and all, 500 Days of Summer is a movie which really hits the spot. Its brutal honesty about life, love and relationships combined with the right elements of romance and humor gets its audience captivated every single second of its running time.Of course, not everyone can get the sort of happy ending of Tom right away, but it gives people hope that they're somehow headed towards that direction. It gives consolation to those who always blame themselves for things turning out badly. The truth is, as the film points out, sometimes, stuff just happen and you have to learn how to let go.Oh, and did I mention it has a really wonderful soundtrack? Yes it does. So if you were not able to catch it in the cinemas, please make sure to get the DVD. With a movie like this one, the more you watch, the more you will understand what its message is.

At first I thought it would be just another romantic comedy, then I thought it would be a very good romantic comedy, and finally I found out it was something completely apart from all that. The narrator advised this wasn't a story of love, I grasped that as something they wouldn't play with, turns out he was right, this is actually a pretty depressing movie. Not by a mere generic kind of way, the boy loses girl and that's that. We actually feel he has lost something, and something he had absolute chances of getting, actually, it's revolting. The two main roles are played naturally, the girl has a mystery going on throughout the entire film, we never get the feeling we completely understood her; the boy is more of an open book, a shy guy who lost much of his aspirations even though he had lots of potential.500 days of Summers actually refers to a girl named Summer and her relationship with the man-protagonist, from the first day, the day they met, until the last one. I would divide the film in three parts, two of them are the part with them getting along well and the one where they weren't, these two are interchanged during most of the film in no chronological order, for a good insight on their relationship overall. Until it reaches almost the end, the last part, and it starts following the correct order of events to finally come to an end. The support roles are pretty good as well, mainly with the guy's friends -- they share similar personalities with the protagonist. I also thought the comedy moments were great, lately I've been having some problems with comedies, they all seem rehashes and leave you with the feeling that you've heard or saw that one before, sometimes even many times before, that's something never actually occurred to me while watching this movie, even when you think that the main characters' overall personalities don't stray too much away from the romantic comedy clich Ã, but the way they are presented feels fresh.Well, so much for the heart-warming romantic comedy, even so this ends up being a very touching movie. It's just that it's more of an encouraging ""get out of your seat and so something"" style than it is a ""don't worry, everything's gonna be all right"".

From the very beginning, the author warns us that this is not a love story, and he is more than right. This movie just cannot be put into a single genre. You can say that it is a comedy, because that is what I believed after the first ten minutes. But I was wrong, for the following events were rather dramatic than comedic. I particularly liked Gordon Levitt's performance. I felt his pain, I understood his pain, he gave so much life and authenticity to the character. And since Zooey Deschanel just made me hate her through Summer's character, that certainly means she did a fabulous job as well. The movie seemed completely real to me, and I just found it revealing, though painful. The ending was terribly disappointing, completely unrealistic and sort of contradicted the whole essence of the movie in my view. But, hey, they just had to remind me that it was just a movie after all, not life, right? I loved all the elements the director used in the structure of the movie, all the jumps backwards and forward the relation (call I call it relation?). I liked the whole thing that Summer is just a normal girl, height average, weight average, foot size slightly above average. All in all, it certainly deserves a 9, and for the director I have only words of praise. I think he should keep on directing movies, for he is doing a really unique thing.

The atmosphere, the style, the grace and humor(sometimes they got it sometimes they don't.) They are the very epitome of good fun and romance. But over the years this genre(like I said in my review of The Ugly Truth.) Has been stretched thin and mired down by bad and extremely bland Romantic Comedies that you could see what was going to happen before the film even began. But I'm truly and profoundly proud to say that (500) Days of Summer is nothing even close to the formula of romantic comedies, in fact it's one of the most complex and off beat entries in the genre to come out since in 20 years.This movie I had no interest in seeing at first cause I thought it was just another formula Rom Com and I thought it wouldn't live up to my standards. Boy was I wrong! This movie lived up to my standards and then some. 500 days of summer is clever, smart, funny, honest, heart breaking, touching, sweet and oh so much fun, it's the very core of a great Rom Com and it has the heart of a great romantic drama to boot. It's a film that won't disappoint you and it may change how you see life and love . I know it confirmed my beliefs on both. All in all this film was fantastic in it's execution of the story of a boy meet's girl, boy falls in love with girl, but girl doesn't fall in love with boy; it's so unique in it's portrayal of how love and fate sometimes don't come easy and that sometimes you find love when you least expect it. Or even looking for it for that matter. It was great on some many levels it just made me feel so good and feel so bad at the same time( which is unique fro a Rom Com.) And there lies the keys to it's success and it's unflinchingly honest portrayal of how love really works.Joseph Gordon-Levitt( Who I like, but has never made a movie that I liked besides Miracle at Saint Anna's.) really shows his stuff and proves he can really pull off a dramatic and comedic performance( In the same film! Which is very hard.) He brings a warm and very touching side to his character and he doesn't do it with grace or style but with the honesty of a regular Joe, which makes his character more likable. Zooey Deschanel( Who I didn't like until now.) makes her character Summer a heart breaker and a breath of fresh air, her character wasn't contrived or over done Summer was simple and plain and that makes her something of an off beat female love interest, but none the less is very effective. All in all the cast does nicely in this gorgeous and brilliant Romantic Dramedy.(500) Days of Summer is very rare as I've said and it's great and undeniable fun that is really and truly needs to be seen to believe . I don't think in all my years of watching movies have I ever been blown away by a Rom Com, but now I guess I can. This film has gone down as one of the best since Sleepless In Seattle but I'm happy to inform you that this movie surpass Sleepless in Seattle and makes that film look bad.

The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New Jersey, grew up believing that he'd never truly be happy until the day he met The One. This belief stemmed from early exposure to sad British pop music and a total misreading of the movie 'The Graduate.' The girl, Summer Finn of Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share this belief. Since the disintegration of her parent's marriage she'd only loved two things. The first was her long dark hair. The second was how easily she could cut it off and not feel a thing. Tom meets Summer on January 8th. He knows almost immediately she is who he has been searching for. This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know upfront, this is not a love story.But this review is.

And this is not an adolescent-crush-love-is-blind love on my part.

He follows up his excellent work in ""The Lookout"" and ""Killshot"" and other films with a film that will probably jumpstart his career as well. But hey! I'm a guy, and Zooey stole my heart just as effectively as she steals his.Besides, it's a story told out of order, which I love. (500) Days Of Summer is exactly what the title implies it is, a tale composed of vignettes from the 500 days of an unforgettable love affair.

Well, it's probably one of the best movies in your movie theater for starters. It's a well acted, beautifully shot look at love, heartbreak, and fate. While it's not your typical summer movie, it's still one that you should see.The not so typical story of the movie follows a non-linear timeline. The title refers to the 500 days that Tom, played by the up-and-coming Joseph Gordon-Levitt, must endure and feel the effects of love and longing. The movie begins with a distraught Tom after Summer (Zooey Deschanel) has broken up with him. When he tries explaining his story to his little sister, she tells him to start from the beginning, and so he does. Throughout the course of the movie, the story unfolds in an interesting manner as we find out what caused the break-up.Though you may be thinking that the movie is hipster trash, it's not. Yes, it's quirky and often includes elements that would attract many hipsters (constant pop culture references, art jokes, the fact that it's a Fox Searchlight film), it's a film for everyone. Some parts of it are so quirky that you're almost forced to laugh.The acting is another great thing about this movie. We feel exactly what the director, Marc Webb, wants us to feel, but only due to the intense emotions portrayed by the characters. As Tom begins to experience depression, we feel it too. It's impossible not to fall in love with Summer's intense blue eyes and lovely personality. This intensity is also due, in part, to Marc Webb's visuals. The best example of this is a scene where Tom first has sex with Summer. The next day he wakes up and sings as he's walking to work. The scene is the only musical scene and yet, it's choreographed better than most musicals.So there you have it. (500) Days of Summer is a charming look at the beginnings of a relationship, the end of a relationship, and recovery. It poses the stunning question of ""What is love?"" through it's well-written script and sweet performances. As the narrator says in the beginning of the film, ""This is not a love story."" and it truly is not. It's a look at what happens after a love story. (500) Days of Summer is the year's most quirky look at love and least predictable romance comedy ever. I think I'm in love. ","   (500) Days  Summer exactly?

He artfully crafts a fine film by showing the simple times that lead to complex relationships. Well done !!! Pay special attention to the early childhood setup, this will help you to understand the ending. Summer appears to be a care-free woman, but her character is complex, due to lack of functional parental relationship and lack of structure.There is an impromptu musical dance number that defies description, what a moment !

Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives an Oscar worthy performance, as the smitten would-be boyfriend, who wants a deep relationship and has to battle the realities of the world.

Last year, that film was The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This year, it's 500 Days of Summer. Deeply poignant, original, touching, and creative, Summer is a film which will stay in your mind for weeks to come. Directed by Marc Webb, one of the year's best movies also features stellar performances from Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) believes in true love, in that one special person that everyone will find some day. Summer Flinn (Zooey Deschanel), however, does not. When Tom falls for Summer, a new intern at the greeting card company he works at, he knows it's love at first sight. Summer on the other hand remains skeptical.While there's a whole lot more to the plot than that short paragraph, to spoil it all here would definitely be quite a shame. There's lots of twists and turns, and an ending that ties everything together quite beautifully. The whole thing is done with so much care for the characters, and all of the fantastic realism that shines through just makes it all the better.The acting, for the most part, is what makes a film like this work so well, and this one is no exception. The two leads worked great off each other, showing raw emotion and talent all around. It's simply beyond me how Deschanel can go from a mediocre, predictable crapfest like Yes Man to a beautiful, original indie movie. Gordon-Levitt, as always, never ceases to impress, but he was definitely at his best in the this movie; it's quite possibly his best performance to date.The originality and creativity present in this movie is, honestly, the best thing about it. It's just so damn easy to fall in love with it. The setup of time passing, the cinematography, the inventive narration, hell, even the after-sex dance party in the streets were simply phenomenal. The whole production is just oozing with talent and creativity, and it's astounding to see it all unfold. It's so simple and so effective that it's very easy to be taken aback by the beauty of it all.I could probably rave about this movie for days. It was really that good. Just do the right thing: go out and see this indie film which has everyone talking. 500 Days of Summer is an early contender for best movie of the year. And if that doesn't get you to go check it out then I don't know what will. ","  year,   least one movie  makes  reflect  choices  made    life, one  touches    personal level.

(500) Days of Summer,203,lao4950000,28/Jul/09,10,1.2775537386671236e-14,film movie one not good will even time can way life love just never great two only see world people many ever something real doesnt sense kind man get audience better hollywood isnt right might,0.5,2.0,inf,inf,inf," This is a beautiful film that you simply MUST see if you've ever experienced heartbreak which I'm sure you have at one time or another. This movie is like an open diary to the hearts of anyone who is suffering from or has suffered from unrequited, burning, all consuming love.The movie stars both Joseph Gordon Levitt, better known as the adorably hilarious teenager from 3rd Rock from the Sun as Tom, an actual honest to God sensitive handsome young man that most young ladies would snatch up in a heartbeat. He is literally everything you could ask for, handsome, intelligent, does relatively alright for himself and most and foremost he is a true believer in love. However, he meets and falls completely head over heels for Summer (Zooey Deschanel), a stunning brunette with gorgeous blue eyes with an irresistible quirkiness about her. However, this particular girl that Tom has completely fallen in love with is a love cynic, she unfortunately has been burned badly by past relationships(she never explains exactly how to Tom but we the audience can get a clear sense that she's been hurt very badly and this is how she comes to be so cynical about love) and is very reluctant to let Tom into her life. She later does bring down her walls and let him into her life, letting him stay over at her apartment, having hot shower sex with him, and inviting him into her private world that she normally hides from everyone else. Joseph truly deserves an Academy Award for literally placing us, the viewer right into his shoes......every height of ecstasy he feels when he interprets a kiss from Summer or a sweet and touching hand holding session as a declaration of love(sadly reading more into it than is actually there) to every agonizing low he feels when Summer leaves/breaks up with him. They go off and on again in an angst filled relationship for as the film is titled, 500 days.Now this movie DOES NOT have your typical Hollywood ending where the boy meets the girl and despite going through trials and tribulations they end up happily ever after just like every other Disney movie. This movie is about A relationship, A great love of your life but not THE ONE TRUE love of your life that you end up being with. In real life, we will all meet and fall in love most likely with more than one person in our lifetime. Just because you do not end up married to your previous significant others for the rest of your life doesn't mean that the love you shared with those people wasn't real. The beauty of love isn't that it MIGHT last forever because sadly it doesn't always happen. The beauty of love is that it happens AT ALL. The beauty of Tom and Summer's relationship is measured in the childlike foolishness they engage in when they both shout out the word penis within range of public hearing(private joke between the two), the subtle but heartwarming way Summer knows that Tom is looking for validation from her so she takes her hand and holds his hand, how she went back to his apartment after he gets in a bar brawl with an a$$hole of a guy who was hitting on Summer( Tom and Summer are at a bar when this jerk starts hitting on Summer and even after seeing that she is with Tom he continues to harass her, so Tom being a stand up gentleman throws a good punch to his face, unfortunately this man is somewhat bigger than Tom and he proceeds to punch Tom back and beat him up quite badly) to show him that he DOES MEAN something to her. The love that Tom and Summer had was definitely real for BOTH of them, not just for Tom only as many other posters here have come away believing. Unfortunately, Tom and Summer weren't each others ULTIMATE love, and on an instinctive level Summer felt this but Tom did not, he wholeheartedly believed Summer was the one for him and you seriously couldn't blame the guy. At the end of the film, we find out that Summer does in fact get married.......but not to Tom. But this isn't actually a sad ending at all. The fact that Summer got married to ANYONE AT ALL is a miracle in itself, and she meets up with Tom again in the same spot in the park(she clearly did love him on some level as she remembered that Tom loved to sit in that particular spot in the park)specifically to find him and to give him a sense of resolution because she clearly does care for him. She tells Tom that their relationship taught her that she was wrong.....lasting love is real and she found it. No, it wasn't with Tom but it was thanks to Tom that she came to realize that kind of love can and does exist. Sensing that Tom is desperately yearning just for an answer, she gently reaches out with her hand to hold his.......to show him that he was right and that he wasn't wrong for loving her. At the very end of the film he meets another young woman named Autumn at an architect company who is applying for the same job he is. A quick conversation between the two reveals that she has many of the same interests that Tom has, and the film ends there hinting that perhaps Autumn is in fact Tom's ultimate love.This is a true gem of a movie that any adult who has experienced both the joys and heartaches of a real relationship will completely empathize with.

Ten minutes into the film, I still wasn't quite sure what it was, but I knew I loved it.This is just the movie I've been waiting for. As the tag-line says, it's not a love story, but a story about love. This couldn't be any truer, and I don't think there's any way I would have improved the movie.Let's just get this out of the way now: I love quirky movies. I love creativity, I love new techniques, I love seeing something I haven't before. Let me also say that I am a romantic, and as a romantic, this movie gave me a fascinating new perspective.Zooey Deschnael and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were both incredible, the latter particularly. He was sweet and charming, and it was easy to be swept up into his world. The soundtrack was also great, and fit the tone of the movie beautifully. The story was awesome and still realistic. The writing was genius; smooth, funny, and cute to boot. There were several severely adorable scenes. (IKEA! for those who've seen it.) And the ending, well.. I'll let you see for yourself.But most of my praise goes to the director, Mr. Marc Webb. This was his silver-screen debut, and I cannot wait to see where he goes next. The whole movie was absolutely stunning, beautiful but still real.The way time moved backwards and forwards was very interesting and despite the jumps in time, it was all still easy to follow because the story became my story.All in all, an amazing movie that comes highly recommended. I cannot wait to see this film again, and even more eagerly await the DVD release, so I can watch it to my heart's content. Because life is not a love story, it's a story about love.

Why not? What's the point of clouding the airwaves with my attempts at rationalizing why a movie sucked? It's not hard, however, to rationalize why ""(500) Days of Summer"" was a fantastic movie: it was bold, different, and completely entertaining. THE DIRECTOR: Brashly and uniquely told through the eyes of relatively green music video director Marc Webb, the plot continuously jumps through the 500 days of Tom and Summer's relationship. Webb uses a sm Â»rg _sbord of directorial techniques, from split-screens to musical numbers, all beautifully meshing together to tell one surprisingly cohesive story. All of your questions are eventually answered, a beautiful parallel between lives is drawn, and you leave the theater entirely satisfied. THE LEAD PLAYERS: Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt have fantastic chemistry, apparently developed off the set according to Fox Searchlight. Additionally, Gordon-Levitt's charming and off-beat buddies provide comic relief and context throughout the twists and turns of an extremely realistic relationship. THE BIG PICTURE: ""(500) Days of Summer"" is a movie whose intention is to have you watching from between your fingers one minute, and laughing aloud with your friends the next. You support the characters, you pity them, and if you've ever been in a relationship, you certainly identify with them.

I give most of them an eye-roll at best. Maybe a light chuckle. But instead of invalidating my reviews of romantic comedies, I'd like to propose that it makes a positive review that much more genuine. It also makes it many times more satisfying to find a truly good one, and that's what 500 Days of Summer is. It is an excellent romantic comedy because it balances all aspects of the genre beautifully. There's romance. That's a given. It's comedic, but not the 'somehow they're both naked and for reason don't realize it but they're about to collide and land on one another and for some reason they're all wet' kind of comedy. No. Take that corny stuff away and keep the cheesiness. The comedy is offbeat and witty and never goes astray.Best of all is the story. It's completely relatable. Who hasn't had a case of the butterflies when a new love enters your life and you are hopelessly hypnotized by your own infatuation? You are on the highest of highs only to to fall to the lowest of lows when the definitions of ""couple"", ""dating"", and ""love"" complicate things. The relationship isn't perfect. ""Is this really how 'love' should be?"" you ask yourself. I've gone through all this myself, so 500 Days of Summer really resonated with me. The movie's tagline says it all:This is not a love story. This is a story about love.This is a story about a boy named Tom who falls in love with Summer, a girl who doesn't believe in love. He's the hopeless romantic who writes greeting cards and she's the new girl at work. Summer is aloof and uninterested in Tom at first, but when she learns about his feelings for her through their coworker, McKenzie, she kisses Tom. Not exactly out of reciprocation, but out of whimsical curiosity.What followed was bliss. The highest of highs. They fall in love, or so Tom thinks, and it culminates in sex and a subsequent dance number as Tom walks to work the next morning. All the pedestrians jump in as back-up. Even a cartoon bird comes in the mix. This dance number was a nice touch since it's comedic value contrasted with the rest of the movie.But not even ""love"" can violate the laws of the universe. What goes up, must come down. Tom falls to the lowest of lows when he questions where he and Summer are in their relationship. She's not one to be tied down, so she takes off like the free bird she is. Then there was despair. Tom has lost the girl destined for him. He falls in a downward spiral of alcohol and cynicism.However, seasons change. Autumn. Winter. Spring. Eventually, Summer returns, but now she's engaged and Tom is confused. How can Summer out of all people get married? And so suddenly? She just happened to meet a guy who was right for her, and she saw all the wonderful things about love that Tom has always believed. She explains:Summer: Well, you know, I guess it's 'cause I was sitting in a deli and reading Dorian Gray and a guy comes up to me and asks me about it and__ now he's my husband.Tom: Yeah. And__ so?Summer: So, what if I'd gone to the movies? What if I had gone somewhere else for lunch? What if I'd gotten there 10 minutes later? It was __ it was meant to be. And__ I just kept thinking__ Tom was right.Tom: *in slight disbelief* No.Summer: Yeah, I did. *laughs* I did. It just wasn't me that you were right about.Movies, TV, and music has all brainwashed us into thinking that love is perfect, pure, and simple. And if that wasn't bad enough, they even suggest it is somehow easy to obtain. No. That's bull. It's a lot more complicated than that and it requires a lot more work than we are led to think. Enter 500 Days of Summer. This is a romantic comedy that is telling us just that. It is doing a public service to the love-struck youth by striking them upside the head with some reality.Tom writes Hallmark style cards for a living. They all contain those cookie-cutter, idealistic ""I love you"" messages that are so fake. He eventually breaks free to pursue his true passion, architecture. This is also about the time when he breaks free from his false preconceptions about love and finally gets over Summer. Love is complicated, and for a romantic comedy to convey this message so poetically is commendable.

For most of the film, we're constantly shifting around at different points in time in the couples' relationship (the number of days that have passed in the relationship constantly appear to remind the viewer at which point in time we're looking at).The protagonist is Tom Hansen, played by the likable and handsome Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He meets Summer Finn (the quintessential Indie actor, Zooey Deschanel), a mercurial waif of sorts, who only wants to have a 'casual' relationship. Not only does Tom put Summer on a pedestal but the screenwriters do as well__we find out next to nothing about her except for the fact that she believes that Ringo was the greatest Beatle and she's willing to pattern some of her behavior in the bedroom based on a porno tape the couple has rented.In short, Tom is guilty of puppy dog love__and it's the examination of his obsession that we're forced to watch for about an hour and a half. One wonders what Tom sees in Summer but that doesn't really concern the film's scenarists. We're treated to a series of gimmicky 'fantasy' sequences that chronicle Tom's mood changes as his relationship with Summer begins to deteriorate.In the beginning, after he makes love to Summer for the first time, he's out on the streets, leading a huge crowd of people in song and dance, accompanied by a marching band. Then there are nods to the great film directors such as Fellini (Summer and Tom are now characters in their own version of 'La Dolce Vita') and Bergman (Tom becomes the brooding Knight in a takeoff on the famous playing chess with Death scene). As things get bad, a split screen displays Tom's expectations and 'reality', when the feuding lovebirds attend a party together. Finally, at his darkest moment, Tom morphs into a fading pencil drawn figure against an animated background.'Summer' aims at some comic relief as the Greeting Card company that Tom and Summer work at are populated with quirky characters who always are trying to come up with new pithy sayings for the wacky greeting cards they're attempting to compose. Also in the mix are Tom's two best friends who appear to have less than stellar love lives. Perhaps the least humorous of the comic relief is Tom's younger sister, who occasionally pops up and offers obnoxious advice about dating etiquette.Tom eventually overcomes his depression over losing Summer by quitting his job at the greeting card company and going on job interviews at architectural firms, where he seeks to pursue his life-long job working at a 'legitimate' job as an architect. As for Summer, Tom is confused by her sudden decision not to pursue 'casual' relationships anymore, and get married.'500 Days' has a very nice look to it and its witty pop culture reference will keep your interest. But in the end, it has little to offer in terms of appealing to the intellect. Do we really care about Summer, a cipher of a character who's put on a pedestal ? And what's so captivating about Tom's obsession and decline into depression? If you're looking for escapist entertainment to pass some time, '500 Days' fits the bill. But ultimately, I doubt that this film will be remembered in the coming years as a romantic comedy classic, or even remembered at all.

This is a story about love."" The following quote is too true about this film, and is the perfect description of it. ""500 Days Of Summer"" is a wonderful tale about love, loss, heartbreak, and dealing with those emotions. The story is beautifully told through one of the most original and captivating scripts of the year, and carried by the phenomenal breakout performance of Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I don't really think I've ever seen a movie, or an actor, capture the emotions as well as this movie and its star do.There's no question that this film is the breakout indie comedy of 2009, like ""In Bruges"", ""Little Miss Sunshine"", ""Juno"", and ""Sideways"" before it. But the question is, why is it that movie? Like those movies listed above, ""500 Days Of Summer"" is so realistic and true in its approach that it never feels redundant or clich Ãd, despite being in the most formulaic and clich Ãd genre of film. Whether its approach be comedic, tragic, or just all out absurd (wait for the musical number!), ""500 Days Of Summer"" hits every note with perfection, whether or not the audience will like what they see.There are those who simply know Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the kid from ""Angels In the Outfield"" or ""3rd Rock From the Sun"", but from now on, this will be what he's remembered for until he tops this (which, with his talent, is definitely going to happen). Gordon-Levitt's tactful and emotional take showed me something I rarely see: the ability to connect with each audience member on a personal level. It's one of the most emotionally stirring performance I've seen in many years. Throughout the film, I knew I was watching some of the best acting of the year because I not only recognized similar events that occur throughout Tom's relationship with Summer, but I remember feeling exactly what Gordon-Levitt portrays on screen. He really is a gem of an actor that should be watched for years to come (this is of course, something I've been saying for years, (but no one seemed to listen). An Oscar nomination is not out of the question here.I don't know if it was just me and my date, but Zooey Deschanel's performance, while good, seemed more like the script being tailor made to her abilities as an actress. In short, her performance was enjoyable, and at times adorable, but I've seen her do the same thing in almost every role she's played, especially in ""Elf"" and ""Yes Man"" (in fact, her take on Summer is nearly identical to her performance in ""Yes Man""). I just don't think I'm as enamored with her as everyone else, but in no way does she detract from the film at all.Perhaps the only romantic comedy clich Ã that is present here is the strength of the supporting cast, who I loved. I couldn't get enough of Geoffrey Arend as Tom's friend McKenzie, as he delivers some of the movie's funniest moments (and trust me, there are plenty, especially in the beginning and middle). Clark Gregg hits all the right notes, while Chloe Moretz is the sometimes hilariously great voice of reason that is Tom's little sister. Cameos from Minka Kelly and Ian Reed Kesler are also very well done.If I had to pick out some problems, which would be nitpicking, I'd say that the movie is really short. With a story that literally encompasses 500 days (which are conveniently all in the same season...well, I guess that's Los Angeles for you), you'd think they'd need a little more time to cover it, as the film runs under 2 hours even with previews. I also didn't necessarily like a turn the script took later in the film, but it made sense and worked in the end, so it's really a non-issue.Back to the things I liked about this one. There's a great amount of laughter and smiles in this movie, despite it taking a very serious tone towards the end. My face hurt from smiling so much. I also really loved the music, whether it was the composed music or the songs used throughout. This is a very stylish movie that, like ""Juno"" and ""Garden State"" before it, should spawn a bit of a mini-cult of people emulating the style (I know I want Tom's wardrobe). It's a good natured movie that will bring out your emotions and make you think about love in general, and how you've experienced it. It really is a crowd pleaser at its core, even if it's not a typical crowd pleaser.A question a lot of people might have is, ""is this a good date movie?"". The answer is yes, but only if that date is someone you genuinely care about and/or - shocker here - love. It's not something you want to take someone to unless you know them well enough to see a movie like this, because...remember, it's not a love story, it's a story about love. In fact, it may be the best romance film I've seen in many years. "," ""  not  love story.    story  love.""   quote   true   film,    perfect description  .

The only problem is that Summer does not believe in love. But in one instance, they fall in love. The difference between this romance and about 95% of the romances in other rom-coms is that this romance did not happen in the snap of a finger. They actually take their time to show how they fell in love. The supporting players such as comedian Geoffrey Arend as Tom's friend and co-worker, McKenzie, and Matthew Gray Gubler (he plays Dr. Spencer Reid on TV's Criminal Minds) as Tom's friend Paul add to the laughs and the delight. Although not quite groundbreaking, it's one of the best films of the year so far, and I highly recommend you go see it.

(500) Days of Summer,215,jaredmobarak,08/Jul/09,9,1.2168055744994762e-19,film one not story good comedy even can way life love make just makes may work performances director little enough look drama fun never great two only see first heart also world though cast without people many something real tale family humor doesnt sense year romantic audience full screen seen isnt right dont moments,0.5,4.0,inf,inf,inf," This is a story of boy meets girl and it most definitely is not a love story __ in the strictest sense of the word at least. Love is a major factor in (500) Days of Summer; just not in the way you may anticipate, thinking the film a romantic comedy. Instead, the tale shows us how love, or the lack therefore, can effect two young souls, lost and alone in the world. When Tom meets Summer his life is turned around to sunshine and rainbows__a full dance number, complete with Disney-fied bluebird, expresses this fact. What he doesn't know that first day is that when she tells him she isn't looking for anything serious, she means it. Tom's journey to salvation or damnation is one through the rough and tumble world of love and he is its punching bag. But one must realize that all things happen for a reason, we all need to find that love-struck puppy to show us it exists as more than a dream and we all need to find that cynical non-believer to help build up the skin and realize life isn't perfect.Tom's younger sister Rachel, played wonderfully by Chloe Moretz, is the voice of reason on all things relationship. She says the one thing that all people involved in a breakup need to hear. It wasn't always good; you can't remember the one that got away in love-rimmed glasses. You need to look again and see the bad, see the ways in which he or she let you down and realize that it wasn't meant to be. Maybe they left because what you felt wasn't in their heart and, truthfully, that is a good thing. You don't want to be in a relationship built on lies; sometimes you just aren't meant to be together. So many lines in this film resonate as nuggets of wisdom so true, yet ignored when it is you those words are trying to hit. Tom asks Summer what went wrong with all her previous boyfriends and she responds with, ""What always happens? Life"". It isn't always written in stone, nor is anything permanent. Each one of us needs to work as hard as he can to keep a relationship alive because love is not always enough. But when you find that person you are meant to be with, ""you'll just know"". You'll see that thing that you could not find in the ones before.That's enough of the pain for now, though. Despite this being a story about heartbreak and the love that caused it and that which heals it, there are a lot of laughs to go with the serious drama. What makes that drama hit so hard is not only the fact that the emotions are all laid out raw and unfiltered, but also because of the levity used to temper it all. The tone is set very early as the film begins with a disclaimer cautioning that any resemblances to real life are merely coincidental __ even for the girl on whom Summer is based. This little touch, showing the audience how personal the tale is to the writers adds one more layer to its everyman disposition. We are experiencing something we have all seen in real life, whether to us or someone close__the pain of rejection, the confusion of utopia's demise. The humor is offbeat throughout and adds just the right amount of indie flair to make it endearing. How else could a full dance number work in the middle of a non-linear narrative about a breakup so devastating our lead spends almost half his 500 days without the girl, just reminiscing on what they had__or what he thought they had? And don't forget Geoffrey Arend's physical comedy, stealing scenes and standing out just as he did in Supertroopers and Garden State.However, it is watching Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel interact as Tom and Summer that is amazing. The chemistry is there, something Gordon-Levitt said was easy due to the fact he listened to her album with M.Ward__making up the duo She and Him__each morning. Having been love interests in the fantastic film Manic, although under very different circumstances in that heavy drama, surely helped too. Their rapport is honest and relatable; watching them have fun in Ikea, making it their own personal playhouse, is great. Comedic timing precise and possibly ad-libbed, lines like ""honey, don't look now but a Chinese family is in our bathroom"" land direct hits. But those moments aren't only utilized for laughs; they also show the symmetry of life by using the line as an example of bliss for day 38, but also of distance and disinterest come day 191. Life definitely happens to this couple, making them stronger even if a year of pain and weakness is necessary to acquire that strength.Told out of order, we experience the 500 days of the title just as the writers want us to. Days are coupled to mirror each other for greater emotive force, they are shown in sequence quickly as a humorous device expressing days spent in bed depressed, and they are paired to prove how fickle dating is as one day Tom is in love and the next they are through, even though they never were a they to that point. Kudos to director Marc Webb for going all out: getting stellar performances from his cast and infusing unique style, a rockin' soundtrack, and even moments of animated sketches. Rarely can you put life in all its glorious blemishes and bruises on screen without the need to tack on a happy ending or contrived moment of explanation, sometimes there aren't any. But this is a story about a boy and girl who went through adolescence listening to sad, melancholy Brit-pop. We're lucky these kids aren't Goths as a result, just two souls looking for answers, unsure if the other can supply them.

(500) Days of Summer,217,Roland E. Zwick (magneteach@aol.com),10/Jan/10,7,6.55907682300776e-06,movie one not story comedy will even films time characters much love make work performances two first often doesnt romantic kind audience far long,0.5,6.0,9.640424350959331e+302,inf,4.704470961736774e+283," ""(500) Days of Summer"" is not the first movie to tell a love story using an unorthodox chronology - with ""Two For the Road,"" ""Betrayal"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" having done brilliant trailblazing work in this area long ago. Yet, while ""Summer"" is not quite in the same league with those three earlier masterpieces, it's certainly miles above the formulaic nonsense that too often passes for romantic comedy these days.Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who in ""Mysterious Skin"" delivered one of the truly searing dramatic performances of recent times, here displays a similar adeptness at light comedy playing Tom Hansen, a greeting-card writer who falls head-over-heels in love with Summer Finn (the adorable Zooey Deschanel), a newly-hired assistant in the office.While Tom is dead-set on having a meaningful, permanent relationship, Summer feels no compulsion to throw herself into any kind of long-term commitment, determined to savor the freedom that comes with being attractive and unattached in a buzzing metropolis like Los Angeles.Rather than following a strictly linear chronology, the screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Mark H. Weber freely jumps around in time, a technique that allows us to observe the various stages of the couple's courtship simultaneously. But fear not, for the writers are careful to identify, through numbered title cards, which of the 500 days any particular scene is taking place on so the audience doesn't become disoriented. This ""dramatic irony"" approach of letting us in on where the relationship will eventually wind up - beyond what even the characters themselves know at the time - adds an additional layer of poignancy to the romance.Astutely directed by Marc Webb, ""(500) Days of Summer"" is marked by smart writing, perceptive storytelling, charming performances, occasional flights of fancy and a rich attention to detail. And there's a scene on a park bench near the end of the movie that is absolutely heartbreaking.A quick FYI: for a far more somber version of pretty much the same story, check out the equally fine ""The Hottest State"" by Ethan Hawke. Together, these two films would make for an interesting double-bill.

Just briefly it is about a young man named Tom, who falls for his new co-worker Summer and while they begin to bond and become good friends, he wants a much more committed relationship, whereas she wants it to be casual and sometimes seems to be giving Tom the brush off, so to speak. With the help of his friends and little sister, Tom tries to put all the pieces together to win Summer over, but along the way he does discover a lot more about himself, her and how tricky relationships can be. 500 Days Of Summer is not your typical film about love and I am hoping that that fact will not put too many viewers off. If you were hoping to see a predictably happy and schmaltzy head over heels in love film, then you should probably check for a different film to see, or if you are a little more experimental than give this one a try. By the end of the film it reminded me a lot of some of my favourite Woody Allen relationship comedy dramas of the 70's like Annie Hall and Manhattan. They both offer up some of the most witty, human and realistic looks at love and relationships I have ever seen and both sets of films do so in a quirky and sometimes offbeat kind of way and also blends comedy into the mix to make things interesting. Even the character personalities of Tom and Summer reminded me of a lot of the male and female leads in those Woody Allen pictures as well. A lot of the times because of how real and believable they seemed and because they were actually smart and well spoken characters who knew what they were talking about and what they wanted. They can get a bit high strung and over analyze things at times, but I also enjoyed that perspective of the film as well because honestly speaking, which of us does not do that at all in any sort of a difficult situation? I also really liked Tom and Summer because while watching the film I felt like I got to know them better and it were like watching everyday average people and even with their quirks and sometimes stubbornness that at times drove them throughout the film, I still really liked these characters, flaws and all. Not to mention that Joseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel who play these characters do a fantastic job. I also must mention the low key yet interesting direction of the film's director and the brilliant dialogue and look at human nature and relationships that felt like the most honest film about said subject I have seen in awhile. All this may sound like a heavier and more depressing film, but it is anything but. At times it was very cheerful and always left the door for the characters open to new possibilities and outcomes. Some of the humour in the film works quite well also, so it is not a depressing experience at all. I think if anything the film will offer couples who go to see it a lot to talk about. Not necessarily concerning ruining their relationships, but perhaps in some ways to make it better and discuss things about it that they normally might not have. For it's depth, insight and charm 500 Days Of Summer is a definite winner and one of the best films of the year.

I am happy to write these two words in capital letters. Nothing is new in this world. It is impossible to come up with the new plot about love or possibility of love, or expectation of love or losing it but it is possible to look at the old story with a fresh eye and make the movie as enchanting as 500 Days of Summer. The first time director Marc Webb has started on a very high note. His movie is charming (I know I use this word a lot but it describes 500 days perfectly). It combines many different techniques and succeeds adorably in following two leads and their 500 days of getting together and gradually drifting apart. It is rarely I see the movie which makes me smile from the beginning to the end. I felt like that big silly grin was glued to my face and I did not mind. It is nothing Webb did that I have not seen before - broken narrative,jumping back and forward in time, using the split screen technique (which makes the best scene in the film with many memorable scenes), inserting a musical number that seems to come from a Bollywood movie,changing the real world into animation. Yes, I've seen this all before but all together these tricks have mixed in something magical, delicately bitter-sweet and funny without being stupid, loud, vulgar, and pushy. The big part of the magic is with no doubt an undeniable palpable chemistry between two leads, both known for their previous performances in the independent movies. Zooey Deschanel (Summer) was the best part of All the Real Girls (2003). As for Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Tom), I believe he is becoming one of the best actors of his generation. Few years ago I wrote about his performance in George Araki's Mysterious Skin, ""Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is simply the shining star of the film and I'll make sure from now on to check out all his new movies"". I am glad that I check this movie. It has generated a lot of positive reviews, and it deserves them. Time will tell but I think 500 Days of Summer may become Annie Hall for the modern time. Yes, I believe it is that good. There were few things that I did not like very much, for example a clich Ãd smart-alecky rather annoying character of pre-teen sister of Tom. But the entire movie is so good that I don't want to nit-pick and I recommend it highly.P.S.

It was a full theater, and I almost didn't make it in, because only the first 120 people got in. To top off a full theater, the air conditioning was broken, so my sunburned back worked up quite a sweat, but that's already more than you need to know.The tag line says, ""This is not a love story, this is a story about love"", which couldn't be truer. For all of the lame romantic comedies (rom-coms) that believe they have something fresh to offer, I have yet to see one that does, until now. This is for a number of reasons, but most obviously, this is about the man, not the woman. And this is an ordinary guy, not some Hollywood hunk. They're also all very formulaic, and from the very opening scene of the film, in which we learn that our two leads are in a sticky situation, we know that this isn't the case. ""Summer"" offers everything with a fresh and very indie plate, but one that tastes good as well.The story follows Tom (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) who is a greeting card writer, and a talented one at that. One day his boss gets a new assistant, Summer (Zooey Deschanel) who is sort of the typical indie girl (the only generic part of this film). We learn about their relationship in a mixed fashion, we scan through the titular 500 days in a jumbled order, started with 250- something and moving to 1, then going back to 260-something. For the first 30-odd days Tom is too nervous to talk to her, other than small talk in elevators and such, but his crush on her is ever-present to the audience. Finally they meet, and when they do it's movie magic, despite that we already know that something major goes wrong. Now that description does no justice to the brilliance of the story. I can't describe it without revealing much, but it's a carefully woven story pattern that is top-notch, and just as important, feels more realistic than any other rom-com I've ever seen. I could relate to Tom so much on his struggles with his woman, and that coming from a kid it extraordinary. I imagine it will click even better to the lonely 20-something men out there, who I'll join before I know it. Mind you, realistic is different than plausible, but that's a topic for a different post.Did I mention that this film is hilarious? Not rom-com funny, laugh out loud hilarious. And that's another element that's missing from these romance flicks. Realistic problems and confrontations are much funnier than the silly slapstick ones in the long haul.Marc Webb's direction feels like a good indie music video, and that makes sense seeing that's all he's done before this. He alludes to his background with a very funny dance number that puts most movie musicals to shame. The editing is also fantastic, and some of the best I've seen on this type of work (comparing it to Thelma and Bourne isn't fair). And the actors are fantastic, and let's pray for some Golden Globe nominations for Zooey and Joe. But of all the elements, the screenplay deserves the most praise. Creating a realistic, funny, romantic, enjoyable, feel-good, and out of order story is incredibly hard to do. I will remember this film on my roster in the Best Original Screenplay category, even if it gets out shined everywhere else.Overall, it's a fantastic, funny, and memorable film, and it puts all other romantic comedies, indie romances, and feel good-flicks to shame.

Doesn't sound like a very long period of time, but when given the right circumstances those days slowly creep by. A lot can happen in just a mere 500 days, one can find love, lose it, and then discover their true happiness and have their beliefs completely reaffirmed. That is the film (500) Days of Summer in a nutshell.(500) Days of Summer is the story of Tom, a greeting card writer, and his romantic relationship with Summer, his boss's assistant. The story follows the ups-and-downs of their relationship over the course of 500 days. Tom, a hopeless romantic, hopes to find true love around every turn, while Summer, a flighty cynic, doesn't want a serious relationship.The film unfolds in a nonlinear fashion, beginning at the end, then skipping to the middle, and then going to the beginning of their relationship, then back to the middle again. At first it catches one by surprise, throwing all anyone has ever known about story structure out the door, but after the midpoint of the film these transitions simply feel natural in order to tell the story the way it was meant to be told. Director Marc Webb infuses the film with a very pleasing visual style, the film has this almost dream-like feel to it throughout, and many sequences are exquisitely handled by this first time director. As well the acting from the two leads, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel is fantastic, in particular Gordon Levitt. Gordon Levitt's performance as Tom is deeply affecting, funny while also being the everyman. Gordon Levitt at times reminds one of a young Tom Hanks or Jimmy Stewart, and I feel with the right role he can become a mega star.(500) Days of Summer is a film that feels as if it is a modern day fairy tale, while also being highly realistic at the same time. The dream-like look of the film and the hilarity that ensues in many situations is not always channeling realism (not to mention the omniscient narrator who comes in from time-to-time), but what makes this film feel real is the emotions of the characters and their relationships. I think every guy can relate to Tom and his pursuit of true love. Every guy has known a girl like Summer, a girl that they wanted but could never truly have. It is because of this I believe that this is not your typical romantic comedy. It's actually a romantic comedy told for men rather than women, and it's from this viewpoint that I managed to identify with Tom so much. Of course what this film offers most importantly is hope, letting us realize that there truly are other fish in the sea.(500) Days of Summer is a highly entertaining film. It is funny, charming, and hopeful all in one. While this film will ultimately not appeal to all it is definitely worth a look.I give (500) Days of a Summer a superb 10 out of 10! "," 500 days.

(500) Days of Summer,227,MisterWhiplash,03/Aug/09,9,7.256703254817783e-18,film movie one not story comedy well even can characters much make just makes movies director enough fun new never two see first made also entertaining without people big real often doesnt american character feel picture take get audience better really hollywood isnt dont,0.5,8.0,inf,inf,inf," Too often in American movies with romance and comedy, sometimes not in that order and sometimes (if not enough at all) take the romance and personal consequences of a relationship seriously, we're made to feel as an audience by the BS of Hollywood formulas that we should like the characters even when they're wrong or stupid or, on more than one occasion, sociopaths. The pleasure of (500) Days of Summer is that it doesn't tell us how to think or feel about this couple, Tom and Summer. Indeed it would be quite unfair to make us just automatically like a guy who has had the 'first-love-forever' notion since childhood and the girl being one without any real solid core of emotions that one can really connect to. It's much to complex, and by the end we simply understand the both of them, which is all that a movie about two people in a relationship- well, let's not ""label"" it, I guess- should try to accomplish.But more than that, (500) Days of Summer is one of those rare contemporary movies that taps into the ups and downs of a heart-breaker. One could compare it to that other masterful/somber ""hipster"" opus (must use quotes since I can't verify it for sure) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. While the latter had a genius at the helm in Michel Gondry, the director here, Marc Webb, is not one to scoff at, either, at least as a real formidable creative talent whom I can't wait to see more of. He and his co-writer develop this story of Tom and Summer in a manner that one can see the whole 'what-went-wrong' thing in their relationship. But it's pretty clear, actually, from the start: Tom is very interested, probably more than just as a friend, while Summer says 'let's not label things' and just be friends. This is code, to be sure, but Tom doesn't read it, and why should he? It is, at least for him, walking on sunshine with Summer... at least, for the first couple hundred days or so.It's imaginative storytelling and solid character development. These are the bedrocks that make this film so impressive. All one can ask for are two characters who can engage us, in every moment that one would want for a three-dimensional picture. It's been argued already that since the film is mostly (save for a couple of third-person narrator bits) from Tom's point of view, we don't really get to know Summer on the same level. This isn't really true, it's just that they're different people to tap into, but also have been established at the start of the film like comic-book characters with their powers: Tom watched the Graduate as a kid and got the wrong idea by the ending, while Summer kept cutting her hair and wondering why it didn't hurt. One is love-sick and twisted by the promise of fate, and the other is pleasant and fun on the shallow surface and underneath is cold and bottled up and without much one can see of anything of a real connection (a key scene is when Tom and Summer go to see the Graduate together, and Summer sobs at the end with Benjamin and Elaine on the bus- ponder over it when the movie ends).But, aside from all of those ponderous and inquisitive beats about the nature of connectedness with people, of liking or loving or just realizing what one does with their lives as meaningless or with meaning, it's a superbly entertaining piece of pop excitement. It's not a full-on laugh out loud affair, but it doesn't need to be. We already have the characters, and their non-linear track of things as they come, and the filmmakers go for an approach to heighten whatever moods are on display. Take the truly awesome and hilarious 'musical' number with Tom dancing in the street with a whole squad behind him to Hall & Oates. Or, on a more personal-taste level (my favorite scene in the movie as a comedy), when Tom goes to the movie on his own and sees the French New Wave scene merge into the parodies of Persona and Seventh Seal.And, on top of this, the style, which could be dubbed as 'quirky' by those who can't find a better word like 'inventive' or 'smart' or forbid 'wonderful', is Webb's attentiveness to the style as reflects a scene with the camera and editing. This goes beyond just some cheeky-clever student film thing. When we see, for example, when Tom goes to the party that (ex) Summer invites Tom to, very unfairly indeed, and we see the split-screen of the Fantasy and the Reality of the scene, with a movement of the camera to fill the whole frame when the reveal in Reality comes crashing down for Tom (it's a twist that isn't a big spoiler since it's at the start of the film), it's not one of those gimmicks unearned. (500) Days of Summer is a fresh blast that is thoughtful and endearing, and never for a second spoon-feeds the audience.

For that I commend him.(500) Days is so successful in humor, replicating real emotions and situations and making people (me at least) recall memories of our own.

(500) Days of Summer,230,Brian P,22/Jul/09,9,1.4675662584429555e-16,film movie one not story well funny even can way life characters much love just makes work director enough never two only see first also performance world cast without people many ever something real tale often years doesnt character feel year man get audience full moving works seen hollywood right music moments,0.5,8.0,inf,inf,inf," In (500) Days of Summer, music video director Marc Webb transitions into the feature world by telling the story of Tom, a man who firmly believes that true love and happiness are mutually inclusive, and Summer, the woman Tom falls hopelessly in love with but who does not believe in the idea of love herself. The two set out on a tentative relationship, undefined on her insistence, and the story follows the 500 days from when they first meet each other.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Tom with a fantastic blend of awkward shyness and modest charm. His earnest pursuit of Summer, played effervescently by Zooey Deschanel, unfolds with equal amounts of hilarious courtship missteps and gracious charm. For this story to work, the audience has to fully believe in Tom and his budding relationship with Summer, and Gordon-Levitt makes that all possible. His performance here is stellar, crafting a character that the audience not only wants to root for, but in which they can see a bit of themselves as well. He idealizes without being impractical, and broods but not to annoyance. Hopeless romantics typically can come off as desperate or extreme, but Gordon-Levitt plays him with more than enough charisma to win us over.Deschanel is excellent too. She's played a lot of the same roles over the past couple of years, that of the too-commonly seen manic pixie dream girl, and frankly it's an element that is definitely present here as well. However, there's also a grounded-ness to the character, an honesty to how she was written and the way Deschanel plays her that makes Summer so much more successful than the Happy of Gigantic. Sure, she's alluring and enigmatic, but she's also selfish and temperamental, even occasionally cruel. On the spectrum of MPDG's, she's more akin to Kate Winslet's Clementine from Eternal Sunshine than Natalie Portman's Sam from Garden State; in other words, she works here both as that tantalizing creature who ""exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures,"" as Nathan Rabin coined it, and also as a rounded woman who we recognize and can relate to from our own lives.That edge of ""realness"" to the characters is something that is most refreshing about (5oo) Days of Summer. Full disclosure: this movie is full of whimsical and fantastical moments, and has more than a fair share of cheeky, 4th-wall-breaking winks at the audience. However, not only is all of that executed with a finesse and restraint that would put Ferris Bueller to shame, there's a surprising candor to the story. Despite an at-times wacky cast (Chloe Moretz, however, deserves special mention in playing Tom's precocious kid-sister Rachel with a level- headedness that always eluded Dakota Fanning), the lead characters feel whole and fleshed-out. The relationship between Tom and Summer is treated respectfully and sugar-free, taking on its often messy turns with a sincerity and eloquence that doesn't ever feel forced or overly contrived.That relationship is also what obviously drives the movie, and it is carried by the chemistry between the two leads. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel play off each other so well here. There's one particular scene in the copy room at the company where Tom and Summer work that just comes together completely naturally and hilariously. The audience goes through the stages of their relationship and buys in to their ups and downs because it never feels like two Hollywood actors reading lines off a page, but rather two people actually sharing an experience.Marc Webb does an amazing job here, weaving together so many elements that could easily be jarring or alienating and instead turns it all into a brilliant mosaic of love in life. He's knocked his feature directorial debut out of the park, and even the few flaws are easily overlooked for the deft touch he brings to a playful and touching tale. His background in music is clearly evident here, as he's populated the film with a soundtrack that is an eclectic mix of classic tunes and catchy indie melodies sure to get the hipster crowd all atwitter. It's probably only the second film this year after Star Trek that was so enjoyable I wanted to watch it again right away. But while Star Trek was an amazing and pulse-pounding thrill ride, (500) Days is more the insightful and memorable road trip, packed full of laughs and good-feeling.(500) Days of Summer tells us from the start: ""This is not a love story."" In that statement, the wry and observant narrator is not entirely correct. (500) Days of Summer is a lot of things - it's both funny and moving, as refreshing as it is honest, and thoughtful in one wave and provocative in another. It's a unique mix of whimsy and real, a genuine portrait of a relationship embellished with the colors and soundtrack that only emotions can evoke in our lives. It's a beautiful and immensely satisfying film, and so I endeavor to amend the above misguided statement to just an understatement: ""This is not just a love story.""- Roy from http://www.cinemaverytasty.com ","  (500) Days  Summer, music video director Marc Webb transitions   feature world  telling  story  Tom,  man  firmly believes  true love  happiness  mutually inclusive,  Summer,  woman Tom falls hopelessly  love     not believe   idea  love .  two set    tentative relationship, undefined   insistence,   story follows  500 days    first meet  other.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Tom   fantastic blend  awkward shyness  modest charm.  earnest pursuit  Summer, played effervescently  Zooey Deschanel, unfolds  equal amounts  hilarious courtship missteps  gracious charm.   story  work,  audience   fully believe  Tom   budding relationship  Summer,  Gordon-Levitt makes   possible.  performance   stellar, crafting  character   audience not only wants  root ,     can see  bit    well.  idealizes without  impractical,  broods  not  annoyance.

Right from the beginning the movie warns the audience that it is not a love story, and this is only somewhat true. The film is a non-linear look at the 500 days that Joseph's character (Tom) is infatuated/in love with Zooey's character (Summer), all of the ups, downs, and in between stages. What sets this film apart from the genre is that the story is told not from the female perspective, but rather from the male perspective which is very rarely seen in romantic comedies. While it becomes clear that the film is in fact not a love story about Tom and Summer, it turns out to be a love story between Tom and life/love itself. In the beginning of the movie we see Tom as the type of person who love's his life and when he meets Summer he only seems to love it more. As the movie progresses and we see the deterioration of their relationship, so deteriorates the love that Tom has for his life and love in general. However, by the end of the film, though he is not reunited with Summer, Tom has a newfound understanding of life and love, and his character is brought full circle, but a little older and a little wiser.

The actors are not the downfall- the downfall is the director and the screenplay.It is so obvious that this film is semi-autobiographical, a sort of whiny revenge. It's a bit like that clingy new kid who really wants you to like him and hang out and be cool together- but his attempts to be cool and kooky are so forced that the film becomes very strained.Attempts at kookiness include an 'alternative' soundtrack (so we think the film is quirky and alternative, despite it being formulaic and predictable), the play on Summer in the title (it's like a season but also her name, ha ha!) and the tagline (""This is not a love story-this is a story about love."" Actually, it is a love story- just a rather dull one with lots of cod philosophy about love- cos he works in a greetings card company! Ha ha, isn't that funny and cute?). The ending is so sickeningly 'cute', you might actually throw up.The structure of the film is terrible. It's done out like a series of vignettes, which is fine. The technique creates little snapshot moments-perfect for the premise of the film. Conveniently it papers over the cracks the film has as a whole, so you're left with a very bitty film. Sometimes you'll get a good vignette (the one where the couple are playing house in IKEA)but often you will get dull ones. Then there's a countdown of the 500 days, which is done practically a week at a time, but the time gap varies- all it does is drag the pace. Then we have the ill-judged voice-over narrator, an idea which is as awful as it sounds. And the screenplay is incredibly poor- one wonders if it wasn't written by a bad film student, because it is supposedly arty but bears no resemblance to how people actually speak or behave.If you like Zooey Deschanel, you might like this film. If you have low expectations of films, by all means watch this. For an alternative teen/young person film, watch Pretty in Pink. For a negative film about love, you could watch Closer or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?...there's loads of films out there that live up to their promise. Sadly this film falls short.

(500) Days of Summer,235,Michael McGonigle (mmcgonigle@philamuseum.org),31/Mar/09,10,5.7529062763903824e-11,film movie one not story comedy will funny best can characters love just may work director little new great only see first world old something real year romantic kind get better full moving screen right music dont,0.5,18.0,inf,inf,inf," This is a thoroughly delightful romantic comedy that is actually romantic and above all funny. Joseph Gordon Levitt is just getting better with each passing year. If this film does not mark some kind of breakout for him, than I don't know what is wrong with people.Gordon-Levitt plays Thomas, a writer for a greeting card company based in LA. He has been a romantic since high school when he compulsively watched The Graduate and listened to British bands like The Smiths and Joy Division. A narrator informs us that Thomas believes in finding that one true love.His true love turns out to be Summer played by Zooey Deschanel. She comes to work at the greeting card company as an office assistant and they both fall into a somewhat passionate affair, at least from Thomas's perspective. Summer however, is a bit more cautious.Overlay this with a hip, retro score of old tunes and pop-cultural references and you could have something deplorable, but what can I say, this film is genius. We are immediately informed by the God-like narrator and the particularly hilarious disclaimer that this is a film that will not be afraid of using filmic technique.The title refers to the 500 days of Thomas's relationship with Summer and we are constantly shifting back and forth from different days of their love affair albeit with a helpful numeric counter title card. Some may find it disconcerting to go from say Day 4 to Day 309 and then to Day 83, but this is actually a quite effective structure for this story and the contrasts between the beginning of the affair from the end of the affair are sometimes hilarious, sometimes quite moving and sometimes realistically painful as only those who have been in an intense relationship can understand.The creative thinking throughout this movie is phenomenal, for example, to display different states of a characters mind, we see everything from a parody of a French New Wave film with Gordon-Levitt doing his best Jean Paul Belmondo, to a spoof of the chess scene on the beach from Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal.At one point, we break into an extremely lively and hilarious musical number full of marching bands and a little animated bluebird tweeting precociously. At another point, we are thrust out of the story and directly into the offices of a record company where business executives try to figure out why there was a huge spike in sales of the Belle And Sebastian CD The Boy With The Arab Strap in northern Michigan. Trust me, in context, it is quite funny.If this film has a spiritual father, that has to be the 1977 Oscar winning film Annie Hall from director Woody Allen. Like that film, this one is about a writer of sorts and it follows the ups and downs of a relationship with a woman who starts out sort of weak, but develops personal strength as she goes along.There is a scene in this film that is a split screen in which Thomas goes to a party at Summer's apartment and we see on the left side of the screen Thomas's expectations of how that evening would go and on the right we see the reality. This is a brilliant touch to show the confusion between a characters hopes and their real lives and was reminiscent of the scene in Annie Hall where Woody Allen and Diane Keaton first meet and while they are making banal conversation we see their inner thoughts via subtitles.The director of this film seems to have come from the world of music videos and the screenwriters seem to have only one other produced credit, The Pink Panther 2. I had no desire to see that film before, but now I will.But it is Joseph Gordon-Levitt who deserves a lot of praise. He has played very serious parts in the past, from the gay hustler in Mysterious Skin, the brain damaged ex-jock in The Lookout, he was the suicidal marine in Stop/Loss and the hard talking hero of that great High School noir film Brick.But he cuts loose here and he's dynamite. Sexy, intelligent, sometimes brooding and just a little bit arrogant, if I have had any complaint about Gordon-Levitt in the past, it's been that by taking such diverse roles, it looked more like he was trying to show-off his range, but here, he's a total charmer and nothing is harder to do on screen.While it probably won't happen, this is just the kind of small, pleasant film that should get a whole bunch of Oscar nominations. Too bad I'm not a voting member of the Academy or this film would be a clean sweep. ","    thoroughly delightful romantic comedy   actually romantic  above  funny.

From clever juxtapositions of events and the seamless integration of classic films, traditional animation, and a morose narrator, to unique editing and a visual calendar of fledgling love and tragic heartache, ""Summer"" transcends the romantic comedy genre to become an engagingly mature, yet whimsical look at that ever-so-fragile emotion and its effects both glorious and dispiriting.(500) Days of Summer chronicles the relationship of Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel), two employees at a greeting card company with very different ideologies on love. Traveling back and forth in time throughout their 500 days together, pieces of their journey are steadily revealed to create a portrait of love at once wonderfully triumphant and agonizingly heartbreaking.The narrator tells us that this is a ""boy meets girl"" story, but that it is not about love. Perhaps it's the power of coincidence, the ideals of destiny, the wonders of fate, the harsh contradictions between expectations and reality, or real love in disguise. The film may use a well-known storytelling idea, but there's nothing ordinary about its execution. (500) Days of Summer portrays a ""typical"" modern romance with extraordinary methods, including split screens, slow-motion, characters talking to the camera, a full-blown dance sequence, and an impressionistic, foreign, artsy, black-and-white experimental tidbit (among many other fascinatingly inventive techniques).Tom holds movies, songs, and even greeting cards responsible for preventing people from saying what they really feel and for the corruption of emotions, causing them (especially love) to be completely indefinable. It's a fantasy that can only be recognized by or compared to peers who believe they've attained it. During his evolving perception of love, we see a spectrum as diverse as the special effects and soundtrack that compliment the imagery.Using his younger sister as a rational, intellectual source for advice on love further fuels the deconstruction of maturity which otherwise might serve as an indication of education on the subject; here it is as contrasting as the editing that cuts back and forth between Tom's utmost happiness and bitter despair. Summer is the ""dude,"" looking for casual, no-pressure romance, taking the role of the stereotypical, uncaring guy and not the relationship-demanding, over-affectionate girl. She's against the grain, not commonplace; she's Sid, not Nancy. And because of these opposing variances to the romantic dramedy formula, (500) Days of Summer is fresh, different and entirely worthwhile.- The Massie Twins ","   might  unjust  call  ""love"" story   heart  (500) Days  Summer conventional,  never  know    multitude  brilliant inventions heightening  tale  chasing dreams  fateful fantasy.  clever juxtapositions  events   seamless integration  classic films, traditional animation,   morose narrator,  unique editing   visual calendar  fledgling love  tragic heartache, ""Summer"" transcends  romantic comedy genre  become  engagingly mature,  whimsical look   ever-so-fragile emotion   effects  glorious  dispiriting.(500) Days  Summer chronicles  relationship  Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt)  Summer (Zooey Deschanel), two employees   greeting card company   different ideologies  love.

The movie is fun, frustrating, simple, difficult, triumphant, and depressing, much like the nature of any loving relationship. (500) Days of Summer is a traditional love story told in a nontraditional fashion, combining and contrasting over-the-top fantasy with harsh reality. Boy meets girl, girl meets boy, boy loves girl, girl doesn't love boy because her divorced parents destroyed the very idea of true love sending the boy into a downward spiral of sorrow and recklessness.Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is an aspiring architect that writes greeting cards for a living. Of course, he has an even greater aspiration to one day find true love, a curse and a blessing that was embedded in his innocent mind after watching ""The Graduate"" at a young and tender age. His life changes completely when a new Executive Assistant joins the office: Summer Finn (the beautiful Zooey Deschanel), and she's like a modern-day Audrey Hepburn. Who wouldn't fall in love with an Audrey Hepburn? A drunken office karaoke session and a long-awaited kiss later, Tom and Summer Finn are goofing off and holding hands at an IKEA. (Aww, Tom and Finn. How cute.) Their relationship is reminiscent of Joel and Clementine from ""Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind."" Like Eternal, their story is told nonlinearly. We ping-pong between different stages of their relationship, from Day (1) to Day (500), revealing both the beauty and the tragedy of Tom's pursuit to win Summer Finn.The difference is, Tom doesn't have a machine to erase any trace of Summer, but must instead live with the pain that scarred him so deeply. What Tom does have is a great support system: two close buddies who care for him sincerely but have no clue how to handle this unhealthy situation, and a kid sister who happens to say all the right things.Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are perfect in this movie. He is tossed around both emotionally and physically, from extreme highs to terrible lows, and if you don't cheer for him, then you have no heart. She just owns the screen, and everything about her makes it easy to see why a guy would spend (500) days pining for this woman.There are some amazing moments in this movie, beyond the content. Like Eternal's Michel Gondry, Director Marc Webb started his career making music videos (""All That I've Got"" by The Used and ""I'm Not Okay (I Promise)"" by MCR, amongst other countless greats). It's no wonder why his feature film debut is as artistic and as entertaining as it truly is. This is Day (1) of a film career that is no doubt going to be an enjoyable one to watch.

Upon encountering his boss' beautiful new secretary, Summer (Deschanel), Tom discovers that the pair have plenty in common despite the fact that she's seemingly out of his league; for starters, they both love the Smiths, and they're both fans of surrealist artist Magritte.

The narrator tells us so right at the beginning. We meet our two central characters, our two lovebirds, and know immediately that their relationship is doomed to fail. As the film's title suggests the movie takes place over 500 days. But we begin near the end, day 488 to be precise. The love story that's not really a love story has already run its course. We see the end and then we are taken back to the beginning, day one. After that we're all over the place, constantly jumping forward and back in time, a jumbled mess of memories as a man remembers the good times and bad of the love affair that broke his heart.The man with the broken heart is Tom, a man who trained as an architect only to wind up as a greeting card writer. He's a good-hearted guy, a man who is a fervent believer in the idea of true love. And when Summer shows up he's sure he has found the love of his life. Summer's a seemingly sweet girl. She's charming, quirky, offbeat. Kind of like the movie itself. And for that matter like the actress who plays the part, Zooey Deschanel. As you watch the movie play itself out it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Summer. Deschanel is utterly perfect. But as great as Deschanel is, as compelling as her character may be, this movie is about Tom. We're seeing the story from his perspective. We're rooting for him. For the movie to work the actor playing this part was always going to be the real key. Happily, Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a terrific job. Through all the highs and lows of the Tom and Summer relationship Gordon-Levitt captures wonderfully the emotions Tom is feeling in each moment. When Tom's heart breaks yours breaks right along with him.From the moment he first laid eyes on her Tom saw Summer as the perfect woman. That was his first mistake. Nobody's perfect. Summer has her obvious charms but what's really hidden away behind the dazzling smile and big, blue eyes? Right at the start Summer tells Tom she does not believe in true love. Tom ignores this at his own peril. Tom and Summer seem to make a great couple but they want different things out of life, out of each other. Sure there are some good times along the way but it can't last. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel have great chemistry, playing off one another beautifully. Seeing them together makes you desperately wish this was a love story. But it's not. And the way the movie jumps around in time puts a smart, well-played twist on the story. We can see the best time in the relationship, the highest of highs. And then immediately jump forward to the lowest of lows. A great illustration of how fragile something seemingly so perfect can really be. Where did it all go wrong? Tom's trying to sort it out inside his head and we're right there with him. This is a movie about a doomed relationship, about a man who had his heart shredded to pieces. But, no doubt helped by the two great lead performances, it's charming nonetheless. It's not a spectacular movie but it's certainly enjoyable and clever too. It's a movie which puts some unique twists on the typical love story. The biggest twist being that it's not really a love story at all.

It's just one glorious breath of fresh air. A beautiful escape from the mundane, the monotone, and the redundant. (500) Days of Summer is a story of boy meets girl, but it is not a love story. It is a story about love. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Tom, a writer for a greeting card company who one day meets the girl of his dreams, Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel. The film chronicles the relationship between Tom and Summer for 500 days which include love, lust, ups, and downs, and plenty of surprises. To label this film as just a romantic comedy would be an injustice to what this film really is, which is a sincere, smart, and human film about life and love.Films this lively, sharp, smart, and uniquely brilliant just don't come around often enough, making (500) Days of Summer a rare gem. I think it all begins with this films script. The script has all the wit and style that an innocent and lighthearted film like this needs. It is hilarious, as well as heartwarming and deeply moving. Everything about this film is unique and offbeat and the script holds this quirky yet sincere style together wonderfully.What is so great about this film is that is really narrows its focus and stays on a straight path that follows the two main characters and their relationship. There are plenty of other characters with their own stories, but they are stories only mentioned in passing. The real heart and soul of the movie comes from where it should, the offbeat romance between Tom and Summer. The film avoids spinning off in a whole bunch of tangents that don't further the purpose of the film at all. It stays focused on what the audience wants to see, and what we fall in love with. And it helps that it does focus on two incredibly interesting characters. Tom writes for a greeting card company but wants to be an architect. He has all sorts of style to his persona, but doesn't flaunt it. Summer is a very average girl in looks, but she is so different and Tom sees her as such a rare and perfect girl. We really fall in love with Tom and feel so much sympathy for him during all of the tragic bouts of his relationship with Summer. The film opens with Summer breaking up with him, then the rest jumps around in their relationship. It is all told ingeniously and with the perfect amount of organization to the development of the story that it is able to elicit the maximum amount of sympathy and passion out of the audience.(500) Days of Summer is funny, smart, lovable, sincere, heartwarming, sad, real, and human. It is one of those movies with such a rare beauty to it that it is something you have to see for yourself if you want to understand it. The magnificence of it all can't be described in words, making watching the movie such a treat. This is a movie that I feel like I could watch over and over again, probably picking up on more and more of its witty little quirks that the movie thrives on. There is nothing to hate about this movie and it is something you can get so much enjoyment from whether this is your type of genre or not. It is just so well made and so addictive. I love this film.

Most romantic comedies (that generally get, and deserve a critical savaging) go through a boring and dull formula of a pop music soundtrack and boy- meets- girl, girl finds dilemma and is insecure, they kiss and the end. This movie is different, and it's safe to describe it as bittersweet in some aspects. It's sweet in the romance department mainly due to the fantastic chemistry between Summer (Zooey Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon- Levitt). It's not afraid to be bitter, either. The non-linear narrative makes the film more complex as well. The performances are believable and it is great film to watch with the humor and the intriguing characters that it posses. Although the film can fill a bit hipsterish at times with all The Smiths references and the soundtrack mixed with indie and folk acts, which is likely to alienate the audience at times and might damage the care factor that the audience have for the characters, it is a good film. It's worth a watch, but it isn't for everyone, and I'm not implying for a second that people who do not like this film are below the ones that like it.

So did this one at times with little bit of greasy hands but for the most part pleasantly after all. Tom is a laid back guy that studied architecture but doesn't do it and posses an intensive depth of romantic affection. While Tom looks like regular Joe, Summer is is depicted as superb girl, the kind everybody notices and acknowledges the obviousness of her charm and beauty. They both cross each others' path and develop a relationship... The narration clearly states it's not going to be a love story, whatever that means... As a matter of fact, it is a love story - with two distinct approaches, different motivations and yet the common fields. Their love happens to blend a lot of individual takes and differences into the defining common partnership area, but it's not really all that simple. The movie is attention drawing and the essence of the main characters is interesting and amusing. The story is trilling enough and it's easy to maintain a feeling you might get surprised. And the movies actually does surprise you, delivering a genuine experience and powerful message. It excels in portraying the full spectrum of individual strongest emotion - love - in an amazing detail. The movie has an odd splash screen with literally a time-board, where you are brought numerous times during the flick to see ""where are we currently"", on a scale of 1 to 500 days. And oh yes, it goes back and forth as a countryside jukebox. I am not a fan of the non-linear flow which is a key tool of the story-telling in this picture, but it works, (until later on when it's harder to follow). The movie is very clever in communicative instruments and symbolism, however it fails completely in means of building an atmospheric surrounding. What I had a hard time to tolerate was the constant and pounding feel of something overly artificial, even pathetic. The bitterness of horrible attempts to bring some sort of 80's touch mixed with 60's and what not was present from the beginning 'till end. The movie on one hand clearly sets in presence (thin cellphones and Dell LCD PC screens) while the characters clothes, the hairdos, the office furniture, other people in scenes, interiors, car, music, the business suits people wear etc... are failing to fit into a believable contemporary image. What was it, really!? Tom in one scene plays a portable hand-held video-game (out of view) that emits 8-bit sounds typical for 80ties. The whole vintage factor totally lacks the purpose and any possible sense. It simply acts like it's decades ago, even though it told you it's not. Thus it pretends to lie to you, while it made clear to you it's a lie which is a desperate demonstration of a full blown and carefully perfected non-sense that can only give you a headache. (which you may already have from non-linear jumps) In one scene you get to see a brief musical-like performance I could have been spared of, thinking it was just too much (people dancing in sync and sing outdoors along the music) but maybe, somebody, somewhere would find that remotely amusing or humorous so I'll be neutral about it.I am not going to get deeper in the story. You need to watch trough and believe me it's worth it. It's good enough to make up for its flaws. It is a wonderful movie and you will not regret watching it.

The problem is that Summer doesn't believe in love. The film follows them through 500 days of their ups, downs and some seriously funny times.The film is from director Marc Webb. Who is Marc Webb? Well, he certainly has a great talent as he has constructed a complex yet easy to follow love story. The characters are well drawn out and I was impressed by the two lead performances. The film may not be realistic, but it certainly feels it. When looking back over a relationship, we don't remember it all in order. It is the key moments that are remembered which is another strong point about the film. Its ability to jump about the relationship without loosing the audience.The script has plenty of references to other romantic films and even manages to get a dance number in, without it seeming to camp and cheesy.

The story would've been fine either way thanks to Joseph Gordon-Hewitt. His seriousness as in most his movies helps build tension, and makes it easier to empathize what his character is going through. I enjoyed the backgrounds and interests of the various characters and the interesting side-stories at the Greeting Card Office. As with too many movies these days, music gets overused, but luckily it doesn't get too folksy, the genre that really becomes disagreeable for my tastes.

But 500 Days of Summer is different and shows what a real relationship is like, not some sort of idealised version.Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a young man who works at a greetings card company, who falls for his boss' new assistant, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel). Both have shared interests in music but Tom is an old romantic, believing in love and that Summer is the one, whilst Summer does not believe in love and not into relationships. The film tells the highs and lows of the 500 days Tom knows Summer and the perfect girl may not be the right girl.Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber write a very funny, fresh script, with first-time director Marc Webb making it in a stylist, fast paced film. The dialogue was funny, but grounded, stuff that people would really say, adding to the humour. The situation is something we all would have faced, we have idealised someone we liked, focusing on all the good aspects, think they are perfect and end up heartbroken when it does not work out. With the nonlinear style it was almost like a Quentin Tarrantino style film (with a lot less bloodshed); allowing us to see at different stage what happened to the couple and how event could have a different mean when looked from a different angle. The characters are natural and real, particularly with what they say, how they act and dress. Webb and the writers avoid clich Ãs as much as possible.Webb injects real some style into the film: he keeps a quirky nature throughout the films, with little tricks like flashbacks about Summer, the cut scenes of when Tom describes what he likes (and hates) about Summer and to the use of animation. This is one type of film a first time director should be being, inventive, focusing on characters and a simple but strong story (and it can work in any genre). If a director is lumbered with a big project as their first film they do not have the experience, they have not yet developed their knowledge and are usually just a gun-for-hire. Webb also does not use a traditional score and simply uses songs, adding the indie nature of the film.Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel were a convicting couple. It is easy to relate to Tom's situation, falling for someone who does not feel the same way, thought I am more likely to agree with Summer's view on love. Tom is a typical man whilst Summer is a indie chick and even when she is a bitch you just can't help but love her. Their performances are natural and believable throughout. The supporting cast is also good, from Tom's friends, one of them being overly eager and likes to drink, McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) and Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler) who had a been in a long term relationship. His boss (Clark Gregg) is even made out to be a decent guy. However there was not enough of Chloe Moretz, who was a smart, wise-beyond her years girl who offers the best advise. Moretz is clearly going to be a force to be reckoned with in the future.A fine, entertaining little film.

Another boy meets girl, falls in love..you know the rest. Yet, as the film begins, 'you should know this is not a love story', you realise 500 Days of Summer is so much more and in my opinion one of the best films of the last couple of years.As with most of the best films the concept is hardly rocket science. To sum it up the film follows Tom Hanson (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his on/off relationship with Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel)over a period of 500 days. Yet whilst the majority of 'rom coms' these days seem to seek their laughs from placing there characters in a series of increasingly fantastical situations, it is the sheer mundaneness of the situations Tom and Summer find themselves in that really makes this film work. For instance a shopping trip to Ikea, a visit to a modern art exhibition or just the sheer fact they met in the bland environment of the workplace.Both Gordon-Levitt are and Deschanel are excellent in there roles and it is hard to imagine anyone else playing there characters. However what elevates the film from 'good' to 'great' is the way it is still able to pack an emotional punch, grounding the characters in a sense of reality. Because the scenes are spliced together, almost like random snippets of conversation in a diary, it allows the director to follow up scenes of happiness and joy with ones of angst and heartbreak, making it gloriously unpredictable and just like the ups and downs of real life.If you are looking for any flaws you could argue the ending is a little below par, not quite as quirky or original as the previous 90 minutes, but this is a minor blemish on an otherwise fantastic picture. It is also worth pointing out the music of the Smiths, Regina Spektor consistently fits perfectly and I challenge anyone not to want to tap there feet when we get Tom's big dance number after his first date with Summer.

Interestingly, though, the male lead in Annie Hall suffers from the neuroticism of children who grew up during World War II, whereas Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) suffers from romantic delusions and expectations of children raised on Disney movies and romantic comedies (specifically, Tom misinterpreted The Graduate as a child). Annie Hall isn't the only film 500 Days of Summer brings to mind. Zooey Deschanel plays the Summer Finn, who seems like a watered-down version of Kate Winslet's character in Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind __ her hair color isn't turning any heads, but she still gets her kicks from sweetly screaming dirty words in public parks. The two films also go back in forth between post-break up misery and pre-break up joy. There's even a little bit of Little Miss Sunshine, with Chloe Moretz as Tom's sassy but wise little sister. (500) Days of Summer, in trying to be as original as the three films mentioned, ends up oscillating between insightful observations and self-conscious sentimentality. The film tells the rarely told story of a relationship in which the girl cannot bring herself to love the likable boy as much as he loves her. It happens often enough in real life, as romantic desperation leads members of both genders to see love in themselves and in others where it just doesn't exist. It's too bad that the poignant core of the film is clouded indie-film tropes. Take for instance that Gordon-Levitt works in a greeting card company, even though he dreams of becoming an architect. Of course, any character that isn't pursuing his dream job is in dire need of a wake-up call. Telling an indie film crowd this is like telling doctors that medicine is the noblest profession. Deschanel's character would be wholly unoriginal if Deschenal wasn't herself an interesting actress. She's strikingly pretty. She's independent but feminine. She'd be the dream girl if she didn't give off the vibe of someone who's careless with other people's emotions. It's hard not to like and even envy her, whereas I didn't care for Gordon-Levitt's character. He's supposed to be the relatable romantic, but I thought he was too self-absorbed and whiny to cheer for. Moments meant to show his charm reeked of ""Ain't I cute?"" The screenwriters based the film on true events, which adds a sense of realism to some of the scenes, but also a sense of self-glorification to the film and to Gordon-Levitt's character in particular.

(500) Days of Summer,261, (webmaster@thehkneo.com),05/Apr/10,9,3.0127106267500786e-17,film movie one not story will even time can life love make just makes may movies director little enough drama never two only see old without something real often character romantic kind audience better hollywood right dont moments,0.0,1.0,inf,inf,inf," Coincidence or fate...Years ago, I remember roaming across an old book shop, inside, there is an antique book titled: ""We do not remember the time, but we remember the moments."" 500 Days of Summer is exactly that. The movie plays like random moments of recollected memories. In essence, the timing of each event is totally irrelevant. They are simply memories of what we remembered happened. It is rare that a Hollywood romantic drama steer away from the clich Ã syndrome. It is a kind of movie that makes you love movies. In some stage of our lives, we will all probably have met someone like Summer. A type of girl that likes you, but you know will never be with you. Some call it fate, some call it lust, some call it coincidence, and I call it timing. It is a love story without all the elements of one. 500 Days of Summer succeeds in giving the audience a movie about something tangible, something understandable and something to ponder about.The movie goes like this: A girl meets boy. Boy falls for girl. Girl likes the boy. The two goes closer. The boy wants a relationship. The girl wants something else. Life is wrecked and it's time to see how the boy deals with it in 500 days of summer...What is so beautiful about this movie is that the director puts you directly into Tom's character shoes. It is lovely, bittersweet and knowing. Movies like these do not come along too often, but like a failed romantic encounter, it actually plays out like one. Beautiful yet bittersweet are the feelings involved. Whether you like it or not, one just has to learn to accept it. It reminds me of the time when I met a girl on the plane. From there we smashed all the right buttons. Then suddenly one day, the girl decides to pops up the words of wisdom in the lines of ""I don't want a boyfriend"". Sometime in life, you just have to realise that there will never be an answer to every question. We will just have learn from it, make yourself a better person, enjoy life a little more and just treasure those past beautiful memories and move on. I never asked why. I just walked away and never saw the girl again. It lasted two months.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Tom into a real character, someone we can all relate to. While his chemistry with Summer seems real enough, there is something about the two, that only the audience or a bystander will realise. They are clearly not compatible. Yet, Tom persists. Perhaps, Summer puts it perfectly by the end of the film: ""With you, I just never knew."" In essence, love is not meant to reason with or requires an explanation. The moment you are required to explain why and how and what, it becomes an excuse or thinking there is a reason. Summer played perfectly by Zooey Deschanel. Zooey may seem like she knows exactly what she wants. In reality, that is not the case. She is not the pretty type, but there is something about her attitude, the eyes and something about her that makes her a distant yet fascinating character.All in all, (500) Days of Summer is not your norm Hollywood romance drama. It's like the same feeling as the moment you remember about the last time; you encounter a similar event or situation. It is sad that they don't make more movies like this. While not all romance are bitter. It goes back to a saying: ""failures are what we learn from"". So it goes back to the interpretation of love. The movie seems to say that there are no such things as miracle, meant to be or even fate. Love is all pure coincidence. Maybe in my view, it sounds a tad more optimistic, in the notion of timing. I once told a girl, ""If you don't want to see me again, I will just walk away"".

I have seen a few in my time, the worst being The Holiday (the relationship I was in came to an end a few days later, enough said!) So it was with great trepidation that I went to see this film with the young lady I was dating at the time.Not another boy meets girl, boy gets girl, girl breaks boys heart, boy gets back together with girl and they all live happily ever after story. Please not another one of those. It isn't. This is a film with a twist - that twist being that this is not the happy ever after relationship we are so used to seeing. This is one of the other relationships; those that make us feel like they are forever after but, in reality, are steps on the road to where we have to get.The story itself is very simple. Tom is the sort of guy that falls head over heels in love very easily. Summer is the sort of girl that can have any man she wants but is guarded and has commitment issues. Their coming together is gradual and the sequential nature of the film allows the relationship to be developed much more naturally. It felt like a much more organic process, as it is most of the time in real life. It gave the story a great element of realism, in my humble opinion.As the story develops it becomes ever more apparent that this is not the idealistic relationship that Tom considers it to be. The little flaws in character that we all have show themselves through the course of the 500 days and we, before Tom, realise that Summer is never going to be the great love he perceives her to be.The nature of the film lets us know in advance that they are going to split up and when that time comes the contrast in how the main characters deal with it puts up a mirror to their clashing personalities and the very reasons why they could not be together.The film moves on and we see how their lives pan out. She meets and marries someone in what seems to be super quick time. He wallows in self pity (thats what Morrisey will do to you) but rediscovers his passions in life. The ending is a little too sugary for my liking but the point remains that these two characters met, fell for each other, realised it was not going to work and parted. They each took something positive away from the relationship even if it took Tom a long time (the bulk of the 500 days!) to discover this.So there we go. Not a romance at all. Rather an all too uncommon look at those relationships that shape us; those people that mean so much at the time but who ultimately are not meant to be in our lives forever but whose impact will stay.Incidentally the relationship I was in when I watched this for the first time did not last. Whereas I blame The Holiday for the former, I do not blame 500 Days for the latter. Indeed, it speaks volumes to me and was a rather snug fit for where my own life was at the time.The film falls short on a couple of points. As mentioned, I found Zooey Deschanel a little wooden at times. I know the character was void of emotion (not entirely but to an extent) but even her happy face seemed strained. The supporting cast, whilst doing their jobs perfectly, were instantly forgettable but I think that is because Joseph Gordon-Levitt played such a strong Tom. The ending was a little sugary sweet and my concern was that Tom, having learned his lessons and having got his life back on track, would make the same mistake again.But so would I.

There are just so, so many parallels between what happened to me recently and what happened in this movie.

Answer : (500) Days of Summer. Okay, it's not really a chick-flick but more of a shades-of-gray comedy with some romance. Confused yet? You will be once you press play. Don't get me wrong, it's not hard to follow even with the non-linear storyline but the feelings between the main characters leave you wondering until the end. Also, chicks will enjoy this movie too and even root for the dude in the process. Enough about chicks and dudes, lets focus on Tom and Summer. Yes, it's not (500) days of the Summer season but (500) days of Zooey Deschanel (who can complain about that?). Joseph Gordon-Levit plays our main man Tom. Gordon-Levit is surprisingly becoming a good actor but still hasn't come into his own quite yet. He does a great job of being likable and should have you hoping it will all work out for him in the end. Deschanel is very likable as well, which makes it harder for the viewer to see them go their separate ways. The chemistry was definitely there but as it happens in life so often, something was lacking for one of them (the hot one). It's hard to say what left Summer unhappy with Tom but then again, are there many women that can be understood any easier? It can be a little frustrating watching these two stay apart and not once did Summer lay her feelings out on the table either. The hesitation of romance and feelings may have been what spelled the end for them but Summer kind of set that up from the start. Even with the frustrations and other feelings, this is still a feel-good movie. Summer may have been hard to figure out but it was fun to try. The message I got here is that personal relationships are like seasons. They bloom, they fall, get hot and cold, dwindle and die, and sometimes are just flat out unpredictable. Sometimes the weather man is wrong about the weather and sometimes men are wrong about women. The good news is when Summer is over... there is still Autumn.

There are many love stories and so called ""chick flicks"" out there. There are just as many romance novels and soap operas. One thing in common with all these works is that, the common theme, love, is discovered, lost, and then regained, usually with the same person, or ""the right person"". This is essential to story telling, given that it is all fictional work, used for self reflection. Audiences will feel some form of regret spending their time and investing their emotions into the film, or whatever it may be, if the ending falls short and the protagonist (or group of them) do not triumph in the end. In this genre, the villain is loneliness, or lack of love.(500) Days of Summer is not too different from the other works in its genre. However, it tries to be, and does succeed in doing so. The film constantly brings up, like the aforementioned quote, that these films or whatever it may be paint a pretty picture of the real experience of love and relationships. Usually, you expect for there to be a good ending, where the protagonist, like a child, is comforted. There is nothing wrong with expecting a positive conclusion in life. However, a relationship involving young people usually does not last a lifetime. And the realistic conclusion, is that one should not expect everything to return to their former ways, but one should accept the changes and gather experience from it. There is a scene in the film where the expectations of the young man and the reality of the situation is contrasted side by side. It is basically the context of the entire film. It knows its role as a film about love, and tries to offer you more realism.This is director Marc Webb's first full length film. I didn't know this, and wouldn't have guessed it while watching the film. He is definitely one to keep an eye on, as he displays some talent in (500) Days of Summer. The story is told from the perspective of the man. Though the film jumps back and forth through time very often and too quickly for my taste, it still manages to maintain the right energy between the jumps, and you can always tell a huge difference between the different time periods in the life of the relationship. Just as the graphic preceding the time jumps show the concept of seasons, with a tree blooming and its leaves shrinking and losing color, you can just as well tell the difference in the environments, faces and emotions of the actors (mainly the protagonist). Light narration is needed, as everyone does their job in telling the story. I wouldn't say that the film is near-perfect in any sense of the term in its ability to output the emotions of the characters, but it is in no way mediocre either.It's true, there are many clich Ãs in (500) Days of Summer. Most of the plot, and the events and characters in it you've probably all ready seen before, especially if you're fond of the genre. However, chances are there's a reason why you keep coming back to the genre, and I am happy to announce that (500) Days of Summer offers a fresh enough perspective on it that you will enjoy. The movie tries to be different. It tries to offer you a larger dose of reality to go with your ""chick flick"", ""love story"" fix. And it manages to do so, with style, too. It's also worth mentioning, like the movie does, that this is a modern film. The characters belong in contemporary settings. Ultimately, I'd recommend this film first of all if you're looking to find new and promising directors. But to summarize the film, I will quote it itself, when it said, ""This is not a love story.

It's a movie that is real about romance, but not overtly cynical or anything like that. What first time feature director Marc Webb has done is create (with the help of a nomination worthy original screenplay by scribes Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber) a portrait of how one man sees his relationship with a girl named Summer. This is both a life affirming and heart breaking movie, and it's rare that those are one and the same. Combine that with subtle yet free flowing direction, great acting, and the best soundtrack of the year so far, and what we have here is a real winner. The movie details essentially the 500 days that Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) knows Summer (Zooey Deschanel). This includes much more than just the standard meet, fall in love, and live happily ever after aspects that most traditional boy meets girl movies entail. This has far more going on than that. For one, Tom and Summer don't end up together (this isn't a spoiler, so no worries). The film is presented with a fractured narrative that skips around and is told solely from Tom's perspective, so the unreliable narrator technique is in effect as well. The movie is almost a post mortem on a relationship that, at least in Tom's eyes, was love at first sight.First and foremost, this movie succeeds because of the two lead performances. Both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are doing some of the finest work of their careers and they make their characters people we know (and perhaps even are). Gordon-Levitt plays Tom as a modern day hopeless romantic, well aware of the silliness of believing in storybook romances, but he does anyway. He also has to display the full gamut of emotions, as he has to play Tom as longing for Summer, being overjoyed at being with Summer, loving Summer, hating Summer, missing Summer, and so on. It's a tough role that he hits a home run with. Deschanel is just as good with an even harder role. She's not so much playing a character as she inhabits Tom's current view of this thing we know of as Summer. On rare occasions we might be seeing hints at the ""real Summer"", but for the most part she's portraying what he currently thinks of her. Both actors are always good, but here, they're both fantastic and essay memorable roles that are worthy of being remembered come awards time.Director Webb is playful with his movie, but never loses control. He knows exactly the movie he wants to make (a mix of such diverse films as Juno, Annie Hall, Memento, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, High Fidelity, Manhattan, Garden State, and The Graduate) and never hits a wrong note. Even the things that could normally be a detractor in a ""quirky"" movie like this, such as dream sequences, song and dance, animation, weird friends, a second narrator who pops in here and there and is not a character in the film otherwise, a little girl wise beyond her years, and split-screen are handled perfectly, so the movie is instead better for their presence. It really is a perfect match of director and script.By being somewhat of a scrapbook about the 500 days that Tom interacts with Summer, the film presents itself as a series of memories about Summer from Tom's point of view. We are never sure if everything is the exact truth (on more than one occasion, we may or may not be seeing what really happens), and that creates an interesting feeling while viewing the flick. The movie wants to be about the moments in between what most generic films show to audiences, and it's a complete success at doing so. It's almost as if we're with Tom as he recounts this to us, his memory skewed by personal history and his current mood. It all sounds more complicated then it is, but it's this type of creativity and uniqueness that makes (500) Days of Summer the brilliant experience that it is.What I love about this movie so much is that it's realistic about relationships and the crapshoot nature that they tend to be. Men and women may view this movie very differently since it's from Tom's perspective, but everyone will no doubt see a bit of themselves in this movie. Whether you've been jilted in love, are happily in love, miss the one that got away, or none of the above, the film will speak to you in some small way. (500) Days of Summer will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you smile, and it will make you think. Most of all it will make you appreciate the fine work of cinema that it is. The movie is an Oscar dark horse, so keep an eye out for it, but take it from me, this is a masterpiece that you will no doubt treasure and remember as one of the finest films of 2009.

He sticks to his word. Throughout the movie, the viewer digests this movie as rather a story about love. A very unbalanced love at that, and how love can go wrong. Joseph Gordon Levitt plays Tom, a man who works at a greeting card factory, but dreams of becoming an architect. Tom falls in love with a miss in vintage clothing and an unforgettable personality, also known as Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel. It takes a little karaoke and a little getting to know each other for Summer to start feeling something for Tom. Although, she makes it clear from the beginning that she is ""not looking for anything serious."" Tom, a sap for her beauty and personality, rapidly over looks this desire of hers, and continues in pursuing Summer's desire for him.This movie is the anti-romantic of stories about love. Tom continues to chase this semi-bohemian girl, who could manipulate anyone to give her anything she wants with her cute and quirkiness, who ends up leaving him. Although, surprisingly not depressing, this movie takes you all across the board. Tom goes to all lengths to get her back, and forget her. Deschanel continues to play vibrant characters such as her previous role in Yes Man, and her role as Summer in this movie was enjoyable to watch. As the movie went on, it was definitely displeasing, but by then end I found myself craving more. Marc Webb, the director, really replenishes our system with absolute love for the characters, but also reality. As we continue to see the hopeless romantic movies spilling out into theaters one after another, this movie sets a revitalizing tone for the viewers that makes you ache with love for the movie by the end. Marc Webb did a great job with (500) Days of Summer, which needs to be applauded. He, at first, fell into the typical romantic comedy, but immediately took a turn for the better.

Any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental.Especially you Jenny Beckman.Bitch.And so begins (500) Days of Summer (2009), a low-key film about a boy, Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who falls in love, and a girl, Summer (Zooey Deschanel), who does not. But, as the narrator makes clear, this is not a love story. From the opening sequence it's clear the writers have an axe to grind, and grind they do. But this isn't a 95 minute revenge film. It's an honest look at a difficult relationship. Tom is at fault as much as, or perhaps more than, Summer. Tom pushes Summer to make the relationship something more, something official, but Summer doesn't use terms like boyfriend, girlfriend, or relationship. Summer prefers 'friends', even when they are sleeping together. During the 500 days, things get so good for Tom that he breaks into song and dance with passersby to the sound of You Make My Dreams by Hall and Oates, animated blue birds even join the scene. But things get so bad for Tom that he breaks plates, with his head.Like a Tarantino film, we jump around within the 500 days of Tom and Summer's relationship, or should I say friendship? Before each scene, we're shown a title card of a cityscape with a tree in the foreground, along with the day. The color of the sky, and leaves on the tree, clue us in to what's ahead. It's clever, and it works.Tom's friends add comic relief and are a welcome addition to the story. McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend), who works across from Tom at New Hampshire Greetings, (yup, Tom writes greeting cards) is there to question Tom and say what Tom is unable to say. You may remember Geoffrey Arend from Super Troopers (2001), he made a lasting impression there, and does likewise here. I hope to see more of him in the future. Tom's other friend, Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler), looks like John Waters, circa 1972. I imagine Paul sneaking off to shoot independent films starring a 300 pound drag queen. One character we don't see enough of is Tom's 12-year-old sister, Rachel (Chlo Ã Moretz), whose knowledge and understanding exceeds her years. She's the one to call when Tom needs leveled out. This is the first I've seen of Chlo Ã Moretz, but based on her performance, I'm sure we'll see more of her.Elements of Heath Ledger and (the good acting parts of) Keanu Reeves are found in Joseph Gordon-Levitt's acting, he's great on-screen. Check out Brick (2005) to see him in another great performance. Zooey Deschanel pulls off the subdued over-confident Summer, but doesn't give it the charm Ellen Page gave to the equally subdued and confident Juno. The biggest flaw in the film is the pacing and retracing of similar ground. The relationship goes up and down, almost to the point of nausea. This might have been done purposefully, but takes away from the enjoyment of the scenes.The film hit home for me because I once dated a girl like Summer (or were we just friends, guess I should ask Summer). I won't go into details, but watching this story unfold was like looking into a mirror of my experience, a fun house mirror, but a mirror all the same. If you are still in the dating game, and you learn nothing else from (500) Days of Summer, remember these two things: Never make a girl a mix tape, they simply don't care. And, as Rachel points out, ""Just because she likes the same bizzaro crap you do doesn't mean she's your soul mate.""

It was so good, from the music, to the comedic relief to well everything. I found it intriguing how apathetic yet hedonistic Summer seemed to be most of the time. It was interesting how her parents divorce has such an effect on her yet Tom was just fine. It was almost a role reversal with how Tom was the one desperate for true love and Summer was fully resigned about it. I think that was really broadcasted when they were in the diner and Summer identified with Sid Vicious and labeled Tom as Nancy. I liked how connected you seemed to be with Tom.

Writers Scott Neustader and Michael H. Weber demonstrate a keen understanding of the bumpy road of romance and have been able to make a film that balances humor and tenderness very well. Director Marc Webb encourages his two fine lead actors to give performances that could just be career boosts for both. Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a completely different role than his usual stereotype) is an architect whose line in the job seeking market landed him in the greeting card business, writing inane messages for silly cards. Feeling as though he will never meet the girls of his dreams, he encounters Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), a pretty if somewhat evasive and odd girl with her own concept of 'relationships'. Egged on by his friends McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) and Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler) as well as his very bright 'therapist' little sister Rachel (Chloe Moretz), Tom approaches Summer in a courtship that lasts for 500 days - only some of which are rewarding. It is a back and forth game of ping pong, with Tom the obsessed pursuer and Summer the feather in the wind. There really is no particular linear story here, but instead a series of wonderful vignettes that allow Gordon- Levitt and Deschanel to shine as actors. Webb interweaves drawings with photography in an especially winning way and allows the ping pong ball to bounce to and fro between periods of time in this thwarted courtship. This is not a deep movie, but it is a well designed and acted look at love among the young today. The performances by the lead actors justify visiting this little treasure.

He finds this girl, Summer, hence the title of the movie, falls for her, and has 500 days of ups and downs because of her.The movie starts a little off, with a narrator explaining what is what and a silly counter going back and forth over the 500 days, but it slowly grows on you, with the little bits of graphical re-rendering of some scenes and the good soundtrack and the feelings portrayed as they usually are, raw and strange, not something ridiculous and standard like most crappy romantic comedies these days.What I find strange is that I had a very similar experience in my life, yet I could feel no kinship with the guy.

But there is quite a parallel here, if the girl sees her ends are not met and she is threatened in any way, she will JUST LEAVE the guy without any heart at all. Girls who are in a position to know her heart is more important, or her position is more valuable than the poor guy who is madly in love with her. Like Summer, she knows her heart, and her expectations are broken and is prepared to leave Tom. Meanwhile, guys who are so blinded, yes, who literally look through distorted love struck glasses, have known small signs of being brushed off but..CONSCIOUSLY ignore it, and think, ""things will be all right, we are together and I wanna enjoy all I can out of this ride"". That is why Tom's heart gets terribly smashed and gets so dark and depressed. Still my logical mind argues, why does Tom still spend time having coffee and have a great time on that train with Summer? And why doesn't he just leave her, and stalk off? Maybe it's because, in a man's psychology, being hopeless in love is just that, you get so paralyzed and you just enjoy being in that coma, until the plug gets pulled out, and you wake up from that dream into a nightmare of reality that she is LEAVING you.All in all, the movie does all the reality and the angst thing right.

The A-list hipster main cast Joseph-Gordon Levitt (as Tom) and Zooey Deschanel (as Summer) simply put in praiseworthy performances. The plot is non-linear, director Marc Webb does not rush the inevitable, he shuffles between scenes of courtship and heart-break. The lurches in time of the film keep us well and truly off balance. I also like the fantasy sequence after the two finally consummate their love, as Tom dances with a bunch of strangers in the park.I am appealed to the split screen about expectation and reality when Tom was invited to Summer's 'farewell' party. The film actually poses me with lots of questions about love & life .... both are mysterious in many ways. Do you believe in divine intervention, cosmic coincidences or both? Do love exist securely within marriage? How about romantic love before, during & after marriage? Is it possible to love someone(romantically) apart from your spouse? Do you believe that there's one & only someone somewhere out there for both of you to meet each other to make each other truthfully happy? Care to watch it for yourself & reflect on these questions? Presently, for me at least, i choose to believe that love is to want others to be genuinely happy even though we may not eventually end up together; the process is more important than the outcomes.My heart is broken during the scene when Tom spoke up during his last meeting before he resigned from his greeting-cards designer & writer job. A good film is one which makes you smile, giggle, laugh, tear or even cry unexpectedly within the continuous screening time of the whole film. This is one for me. What makes me smile at the end of the film is when Tom dated a girl named Autumn. Watch it. ","   lots  stuff     movie.

(500) Days of Summer,285,Monotreme02,15/Oct/09,9,1.0244646301203474e-21,film movie one story good will well funny even films time can way life characters much love make just makes work movies performances director enough look never great two see first made also cast without people many something big real years doesnt character feel take get audience really screen far seen right music moments plot,0.0,1.0,inf,inf,inf," First and foremost it should be mentioned that the film is extremely well-made, despite its crew being composed mostly of first-timers. Marc Webb, the first-time director, has years of music video and commercial experience behind him, which explains how well-made and good looking the film is. But the fact that he managed to craft such a taught and fluid feature-length film is nonetheless quite impressive and almost surprising. In any case, I expect great things from him in the future. Fact is, this is an entirely indie film but without an indie feel; it's very well shot and professionally made, and I think that just adds to its genuineness. The film also features many elements that distinguish it from just an average film telling the same story: split-screen, frequent breaking of the fourth wall, a spontaneous song-and-dance number, animation, and of course the non-linear storytelling (with a number on screen indicating the position of the scene portrayed out of the titular 500 days to boot) are just a few of said elements that lend this film much of its uniqueness.But ultimately, what makes this movie as special as it is are its characters. I have always said that a film begins and ends with its characters, and as far as I'm concerned, a good, plot-less character study will always be more interesting than a great story with uninteresting characters. And in a film like this, which eventually tells a pretty simple, straightforward and mundane story that we've all seen and heard before, the characters are key to distinguish it, to make it stand out. And this film succeeds more than most others in defining and presenting real, grounded, three-dimensional and identifiable characters. First-time screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber do a fantastic job at defining these characters, but the credit lies with the actors for embodying them and breathing the life into them that radiates from the screen. I have been a long-time fan of both of the leads, especially of Joseph Gordon-Levitt who over the years, be it in Mysterious Skin or in Brick, has carved himself a niche as one of the most interesting and consistent young actors of his generation. Zooey Deschanel has always been wonderful, from her small supporting roles in older films such as Almost Famous to her more recent status as a leading lady, but this is the first movie of hers I've seen that really gives her a chance to shine and portray a fascinating and full-fledged character. Both performers really stand out in the film, and the supporting cast does a great job as well.With films like this, it is easy to appreciate the technical accomplishments, from the spot-on cinematography to the fantastic performances. But a true, emotional connection with the audience is something rare, and very personal. This film connected with me. I just felt a very strong affinity to its characters, and to the situations it put them in. What I love about movies of its type is that it portrays circumstances that are all-too-familiar, drawn from real life, and totally identifiable if one goes through similar experiences in one's own life. I think that anyone who has had experience with sour relationships or with unrequited love can identify very easily with this film and its characters. Or perhaps some people will identify with Summer; people who have found themselves in relationships, basically, in which their feelings weren't as strong as their partner's. Some moments in this film are right out of life __ the moment shared by Summer and Tom outside the bar, when she's just standing there waiting for him to kiss her but he hesitates and they end up parting ways. And the film flawlessly portrays the characters' feelings as they go through these motions and find themselves in these true-to-life situations.This is an indie film, but it doesn't feel like one. It's whimsical, but never precious. It's stylized but never unrealistic. It's very small-scale but it never feels cheap. Eventually, what makes it work so well as a film is the fact that it takes a very simple story and situation, drawn from real life, and portrays it in a way that is cinematic enough to keep our interest, but realistic enough to resonate and stay true to life. It's a film that doesn't reach for the stars, doesn't feature a meaningful plot or story and doesn't convey some big message; rather, it's a film built on moments, beautiful and wonderful moments that make it so special: the narration, the song-and-dance number, Summer's glances at Tom and her reactions to his behavior, the dialogue, the two lead performances, the genuinely hilarious moments and jokes (I neglected to mention that the film is also really funny!) the music, the Belle and Sebastian and Smiths references, the non-linear chronology, the split-screen sequence showing Tom's ""expectations"" on one side and the ""reality"" as it actually unfolds on the other, the moments that just totally capture exactly what the real life situations they depict feel like, such as the aforementioned bar exterior, or the encounter on the train. It's one of those films that stays with you, that you want to go see again and again, to take that journey with the characters one more time, to get to know them even more, and to look into their lives and see so much of your own.

Enter Deschanel's Summer, who's everything he envisioned and he thought the puzzle was complete, only that Summer has, through her experiences, decided in a manner very upfront about any potential relationship with Tom, or others for that matter. Personal Life Fact Check One: I was told, warned even, that it's gonna be casual, with no pressure and we take it as it goes.But hey, when the girl sends all the right signals, you move headlong with it, don't you? And inevitably it was the time of their lives, where romance and spontaneity were the order of the day. No label or ""regonition"" is going to jinx what has been strongly established and what the hearts truly felt, and basically the lovers bask in each other's presence. The scene at Ikea was insane, in a touching way. Personal Life Fact Check Two: Ditto on the labels, and as far as I recall, it didn't bother me in any way. Little did I know of course.Then the inexplicable separation. It just happened. Without much warning, though what Summer did, was like a flashback to my personal past. The disinterest, the disengagement, zoning out. On hindsight we always tend to look back, to search for clues on the first signs of breakage, only to find none because we may be too blinded. Nobody's perfect, though I always think one of the most cruel things to say aloud, is to tell you'll always remain as friends. Innately you know you always will, but deep down always regretting that somehow, somewhere, something screwed up. Then the brushing of the hand away from yours, then disappearance. Personal LIfe Fact Check Three: All the above.But of course with separation brings about the rather idealistic goal of trying to win someone back, which is more or less what Tom attempted, to detriment results. They meet on a train, and decided on a whim to go for a coffee session where they spend some incredible moments post-breakup. Personal Life Fact Check Four: We met on a train platform, though her walking into the train and me heading out of, didn't offer an opportunity to chat. But look her up I did, and we spent some time chatting over tea at the airport one very early morning.There were enough poignant moments thereafter in the last arc of the film to make me go through those turbulent emotions buried deep in my memory all over again, which culminated in what would be one of the saddest, yet happy moments on a park bench. Sad because for someone who didn't believe in love, she sure got that wedding band fast (for someone who told me she didn't believe in it), and also the words that came out of Summer's mouth was on one hand true, yet very piercing to the heart. Happy, because it was one of the final moments you know that you needed for closure, that someone had already obviously moved on, and one should too. Personal Fact Check Five: Well we didn't meet on a park bench, but we met at a mutual friend's wedding dinner. The engagement ring was there so it was self-explanatory. She looked happy, and I'll only congratulate her if I mean it. She got married last month.So that was (500) Days with one of the most incredible persons I've ever shared plenty of experiences with, good or bad. Like one of the characters advised, each time we look back we see all the good stuff, and neglecting the bad ones, which is often why we feel so miserable. The story do take the opportunity to preach what all friends would tell you when you've broken up, either about the other trees in the forest, or the other fishes in the sea... but in any case, it'll never, ever be the same again.If you've made it this far, then allow me to go back to the movie, and I have to admit it was rather therapeutic writing about the above, with the film providing that excuse just to do so. Be warned though the narrative is told in non-linear format, though the animated inter- titles do show at which stage of Tom and Summer's relationship we're observing, together with the postcard perfect landscape where the hues and tones give you that clue of the season, as well as the analogy of the mood as experienced by Tom.Given that the characters have fantastic taste in music, and spend some time in the theatres, there are just enough pop cultural references (love The Graduate), as well as a slew of well- chosen songs which brought out emotions to a higher level. Not only that, the part which wowed me the most, and kudos to director Marc Webb, is the split screen treatment of Expectation and Reality, a gimmick so wonderfully used, that the scene just begs for another viewing of the film.Both Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel did wonders with their roles, and while I can identify with the roller coaster emotions felt by Tom through the former's acting, it was more painful watching Zooey Deschanel's Summer performance, because of the kooky way things happened, and the nonchalance shown which was so, so similar to what I had experienced, as if watching it happen all over again, right in front of my eyes, making me want to scream out to Tom and say ""that's the sign, man, time to bail or be prepared to get your heart shattered"".I like this movie too much, and am going to propel it firmly to the one of my favourites this year.

I will say that the movie accurately depicts how ""love"" works. The fact is, you feel how you feel and you have no control over that. Summer was cynical about love, and set out to enjoy her time with Tom without an emotional investment. Tom, on the other hand was willing to put everything out there for this ""relationship."" Who was the more honest? Summer who made clear from the start she would remain detached emotionally? Or, Tom who was for the most part an open book when it came to what he wanted and what he was willing to risk for Summer? Both, in fact, were equal in their honesty. Both remained true to themselves. Although, you might argue that Summer was playing ""games"" in fact she was not. And, that is born out in the end when she finds someone who trips her trigger, so to speak. That is when she loses her cynicism and is capable of investing emotionally in a relationship. She just needed to meet the right person. That is how love works. Not to be forgotten, Tom, of course, is wounded by Summer's rejection. He laments the fact that she didn't tell him about her engagement, but the fact is he had been warned from the very beginning when he met Summer. A lot of pain can be avoided if we would just really listen to what we are being told and not just plow ahead because of what we think we want and need. As a result Tom becomes the bitter, hurt, and cynical one. And, that also is how love works. Love can put us on top of the highest peak or it can pull us down into the depths of hell. But, as with Summer, and as with Tom at the end, often when we feel we are incapable of loving, of committing, of sharing our time, and investing emotionally, we meet someone who makes us come alive and changes our perspective on love and life. That is also how loves works. Despite the disclaimer at the beginning of ""500 Days of Summer,"" this truly was a love story.

Not necessarily, I've much love for a good romance story but I confess most of my favourites are from some decades ago, but I'm an open minded guy who is willing to give the more recent romance films a go (as long as they've got a few good reviews first). From the start the scene is set, this isn't a typical Hollywood romance, there is no stuttering Hugh Grant slowly getting the girl of his dreams to fall for him, cue some catastrophe which makes it seem like they won't work but OH LOOK it's all OK in the end!! Nope. This is another one of those charming offbeat rom-coms that aren't afraid to be REAL. (Juno was undoubtedly last years gem). The opening monologue of the film declares this to be a 'Boy meets Girl' movie that isn't about love, however this simply isn't true. It's a story about love, loss and learning to move on.The movie revolves around Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who designs greeting cards for a living, he holds a degree in architecture but is yet to break free from the tethers of his meaningless job. Enter Summer ( Zooey Deschanel), new PA for Toms boss, and being so very beautiful and sweet it's only natural that Tom would fall in love with her at first sight. The films direction is what makes this tale so enthralling, the opening scene of the movie let's you know that it hasn't worked out; this match that is seemingly made in heaven just doesn't have the happy ending you will so desperately want to see. Instead the film swings like a pendulum throughout the time line of their relationship, one moment you will be in the early stages of their romance then you will be zipped forward in time to the depressing aftermath. So there you have the setting, what about the performances? Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fast becoming a favourite of mine, I recently read a quote from him about how he isn't in acting for the money, but rather the quality of the script, and well he may just be making the right choices for me to actually believe this. After picking two excellent scripts in Brick and Mysterious Skin he has made the right choice again, he brings a genuinely charming nature and confidence which makes him completely endearing to watch, but when the time calls he can bring a darker element to his acting . Zooey is sweet beyond words, one portion of the film brings a tongue in cheek testament to her beauty (I think the line was she is responsible for an average of 18.4 double takes a day from men), her natural girl next door looks combined with her dismissive views on love makes her the unattainable girl you feel you must makes yours. The chemistry between the two is undeniable, even in the most fleeting of conversations they have you feel the spark between them.The screenplay here is killer to, Marc Webb is handed a script that gives him much creative license. The breakaway scenes offer a bit of random comic relief, but my favourite is the morning after Toms sexual conquest when he walks down the street and bursts into a random song and dance number; the high fives, rocketing fountains and 'batting it out of the park' had me in complete stitches. Props have to be given to the soundtrack to, you have The Smiths, Doves, Regina Spektor and a few more I've probably missed, but they all fit the tone of the film so damn well.Anyways, suffice to say I really enjoyed this. It's the type of film I think we need more of to break the monotony of the generic rom-com.8/10 "," ,  rom-com,  guys worst nightmare?

She's a non-committal type, who ""doesn't believe in love,"" yet paradoxically flirts with him aggressively. More than flirts, sparking a weird and rocky relationship. Artistically, this lays a great foundation for an amusing, offbeat tale. Not quite a romance story (even though a relationship is at the center of the story), but more a character study with optimistic and pessimistic beliefs colliding. Zooey Deschanel's portrayal of the flighty Summer is spot on. Her eye expressions and carefree delivery of lines convey the once-hurt-twice-apathetic attitude remarkably well. She commands the screen every time she is there, and her complex character's insulated insecurity seeps out in perfect measure for the audience to understand. She's blurry on what she wants from life, but she's brutally honest. She appears oblivious to her inadvertently hurtful behavior. The guy playing Tom weakens the film. He ineptly attempts a dull ripoff of an early Dustin Hoffman role. He has the knotted, sweaty hair, all right, but not the acting talent. His bombastic approach makes the character inaccessible, unsympathetic, and irritating. No convincing chemistry with the female lead, or anybody else in the cast, for that matter. Tom's a Loser (with a capital L for emphasis), and goes obsessive emo-psycho. For the sake of both the movie and the audience, I wished somebody would smash those dishes over his head. No such luck: instead, we get the tiresome clich Ã of a precocious wise-cracking 12 year old giving advice. At least she's a good actress, something that cannot be said for Tom's two annoying side kick buddies. They reminded me of two talking Beevis and Butthead dolls that need their batteries replaced. Or their brains replaced. Characters are always in theaters, one of many metaphors launched like a missile attack. Some of the metaphors work, but this overindulgence lacks purpose or comedic finesse. It seems the whole thing is attempting an amalgamation of stuff ""borrowed"" from the movie industry in general. ""Self analysis"" dialog (a la Woody Allen) is humorous but overused. The director has a music video background, and it shows with the intrusive soundtrack. Also, expect music video staples such as overly expressive acting, sultry close-ups, black-and-white imagery, and split screen vignettes. The non-linear construction of the story telling is a narrative style obviously beyond this director's capacity. Instead of using dialog to establish the time line, he amateurishly resorts to ""day number"" captions. The setting of a greeting card company offered a treasure trove of one-liners, plus a great battlefield for the story's whole dynamic. Some of this potential is utilized, some squandered. The film settles for a predictable outcome, with no surprise whatsoever.In summary: thoughtful idea, cleverly written, but with some flaws in execution.

Tom was so easily relatable....and Summer accurately portrayed that capricious nature that I believe women often have that drives men crazy. She embodies what men are talking about when we say ""we don't understand women."" Relationships are not driven by thought or reason, but by feelings alone. I think this movie captured that perfectly...It was bittersweet, a satisfying experience in that I am now certain that my experiences in romance are shared, universal experiences that everyone probably goes through at least once in life.To describe this movie in one sentence, I might say ""it is based on several billion true stories"" - the most relatable film I have seen in a long time! The characters are deep, Joseph Gordon-Levitt embodies sweetness and sensitivity without sacrificing any masculinity; Zooey Deschanel is captivatingly beautiful and enigmatic as Summer.

The boy Tom Hanson (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) believed his whole life that he wouldn't be happy until he found the one. The girl Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) did not share this believe. Were told right off the bat that this is not a love story. Its is however intensely personal, for anybody who has ever experienced unrequited love, which is likely to be a large proportion of the people who were sitting in the cinema. Its a romantic comedy for all extensive purposes, but unlike you've ever seen before. (500) Days of Summer reverses the roles usually associated with character tropes and places Tom as its starry eyed dreamer who believes that true love is just around the corner. Summer, played the dude in this situation. She is just out to have fun and as a consequence they both end up in a destructive relationship.Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel star in director Mark Weber's wry, non-linear romantic comedy about a man who falls head over heels for a woman who doesn't believe in love. Mark (Gordon Levitt) is an aspiring architect who currently earns his living as a greeting card writer. Upon encountering his boss' beautiful new secretary Summer (Deschanel), Mark discovers that the pair have plenty in common despite the fact that she's seemingly out of his league; for starters, they both love The Smiths, and they're both fans of surrealist artist Magritte. Before long Mark is smitten. All he can think about is Summer. Mark believes deeply in the concept of soul mates, and he's finally found his. Unfortunately for Mark, Summer sees true love as the stuff of fairy tales, and isn't looking for romance. Undaunted and undeterred by his breezy lover's casual stance on relationships, Mark summons all of his might and courage to pursue Summer and convince her that their love is real.The film does an excellent job of creating its own sense of style. Before every outing we would see the day we going to. Their break up occurs withing the hundreds and therefore every time it passes that mark were prepared for tears and tantrums. Marc Webb (director) has made an outstanding movie, one that will make my top ten list by the end of the year, mainly due the the raw reality of it. You see a argument occur and its so realistic it almost becomes uncomfortable. Fortunatly the films wins you back round with its quirky sense of humor which had me in sticks constantly. The film seems to have a lot going for it, a great sense of realism, hilarious moments and some impeccable direction and characterization. Its a stunner on many levels none more so than the acting. Both Deschanel and Levitt do an outstanding job at being the fun likable characters the are at the start of the time line and then there almost seamless descent into struggling human beings. They bring life what could have been lifeless characters.Webb's direction is an absolute joy throughout, presenting the story in a series of inventive and original scenes that will stay with you long after you leave the cinema. Highlights include: a split-screen sequence that puts the reality of a party up against Tom's expectations; a French art-house film parody; and a simple but breathtakingly brilliant sequence where Webb uses the same four snapshot clips of Summer to illustrate both things Tom loves about her and later, things he hates about her. The tag line for the film sums it up perfectly: ""Boy meets Girl. Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't."" In addition, the narration insists early on that this is not a typical romcom; instead it's a beautifully written, modern day reworking of Annie Hall that will strike a chord with anyone who's ever had their heart broken. Needless to say, it also has a terrific soundtrack.Verdict: 500 days inst long enough. The warm friendly glow of this romantic comedy mixed with the harsh reality of life makes for something we haven't seen in a very long time. A charming, funny and wonderfully inventive romcom that's easily one of the best films of the year. It is so absolutely adorable that, as the ending credits were rolling, I had the overwhelming urge to wrap my arms around the movie and never let it go. 5/5.

He has directed some of my favorite bands and videos. From Green Day's ""Jesus of Suburbia"" to Brand New's ""Sic Transit Gloria...Glory Fades"" to Weezer's ""Perfect Situation"" to Jimmy Eat World's ""Work"" to My Chemical Romances' ""I'm Not Okay (I Promise)"". I've known for quite some time he is a incredibly talented director...but never in my wildest dreams had I imagined his true abilities. The more I think about it, the more this movie has become a favorite of mine. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel have some of the best on-screen chemistry I've ever seen. They blend together and make just about the greatest semi-couple of all time. This film is set over (500) days in a non-linear storyline and throws you onto a roller-coaster of emotions. For example: There is a scene in the film straight out of a dream where Tom and a large group behind him dances to Hall & Oates ""You Make My Dreams"", an animated bird fly's and lands on his shoulder. He walks into Summer's elevator, smiling and in a state of bliss. Not a second later, he is seen coming out of the same elevator, his hair disheveled and face joyless...hopeless. At the same time Tom falls for Summer, as does the audience. If you've ever seen her, Zooey Deschanel is just about the easiest person to fall in love with, and they use that perfectly against the audience. As the film progresses you realize that she is selfish and you begin to despise her. Something you or Tom, would never think of. You find her painfully lovely and terribly beautiful. You know she is perfect for Tom, but he is not perfect for her. He tries to hold back, tries to not feel the feelings he really has. In the end, you realize that love isn't about the type of music you listen to, the movies you love or the things you hate. It is a feeling you have absolutely no control over: a reckless, relentless and utterly unreasonable force.The utilization of narration is the best I've seen since Magnolia, as the narrator tells the lives and secrets of these two personal, very lonely people. The shots of her eyes, her smile and her expression leaves you floored by her flawless design. The cut scenes are wonderfully placed and some of the ideas that ring true to life are realized in scenes that perfectly depict peoples real lives. From Webb's impeccable directing skills to Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel's beautiful acting, this film will leave you with a truly bittersweet message of love and hope.

But even though this is a great movie the trailer makes it look a whole lot funnier,its actually kind of a bummer movie,it doesn't have a really happy ending and summer is twisted,contradictive,ignorant,unsympathetic and kinda backstabbing bitch,they could have did a better job of making her character likable.

Blending an edge of fantasy with the dramatic implications with real life was a stroke of genius, and here we see a similar approach as director Marc Webb uses real life story of guy meets girl and adds a sharp blend of diverse filming.One thing about romantic comedy dramas is that you know what you want from and the expectancy is set. 500 days is very much different from your average Hugh Grant flick though. For starters we see numerous fantasy montages, flashbacks, split screens and a wonderful music parody of the morning after and all will make you smile, laugh and even come the end, maybe shed a tear. The perfect use of justifying the genre is the split screen just past half way through where Tom goes to Summer's apartment with one side labelled expectations and the other reality. Without the aid of the forgettable narration we can see clearly into the young guy's mind, and there is no hint of hyperbole here, I struggle to recall anything that has been so well thought out in a romance film. It is staggering realistic and such a unique insight into a lonely guy's mind.Gordon-Levitt adds the charm to this scene but his quiet dreams and cheeky expressions will have viewers on his side. Deschanel is wonderfully kooky once more and though you may spite her in numerous scenes, everything has reason in the end.Speaking of which adds a wonderful comic touch and thank heavens doesn't go all soppy and conventional on us. Not since Lost in Translation has an ending in a romance been so well thought out.The pair of actors balances each other well with Tom's friends adding the comic touches; though his younger sister may seem funny it is quite unlikely her advice is as profound as she seems to think. As mentioned Mark Webb's directional debut brings about new touches with his ability to take the picture out of context into his own fantasy world without seeming too otherworldly, which is a great credit as these touches really are the keystone to this film's success.Where it fits amongst other big romantic comedies like When Harry met Sally, Eternal Sunshine and Titanic is difficult to say. It has such an adept approach to the genre and its diverse telling is exquisite and with such a likable cast and array of protagonists, it must certainly be up there.

But you should know up front, this is not a love story."" First impression: was the romantic comedy genre being toyed with?__as if what I were about to see was a pseudo, unorthodox love story masked with conventional love story elements? My assumption was right and wrong in two separate contexts. First, the film's non-linear editing style reminded me of the gimmicks of ""Memento""__that is, would the story have been nearly as compelling were it not for its editing? Conversely, play the film in linear motion: would it fall to pieces? Editing has the most powerful effect on the viewer's cinematic experience next to acting. The editing of ""500 Days,"" though thoroughly engaging, did not, however, make the film.Renoir once said that editing is directing for the second time: it makes or breaks your experience. In the case of both films, I believe ""Memento"" would have bombed were it not for Dody Dorn, but ""500 Days"" would have still soared even with an exempted, non-linear style. The answer: the writing was too smart, even though Neustadter & Weber had to earn my respect. I anticipated something cheap and contrived (like the far too sophisticated, purely obnoxious and childish antics of ""Juno""). I had to be converted, and slowly though, I was.The juxtaposition of scenes strengthened the quality of the film. I loved the truthfulness of the characters: first identifying what he loves about Summer (cut with parts of her body), later slabbed against what he hates about her (again, cut with the same footage). It holds true to the platitude: familiarity breeds contempt. The editing also worked with the split screen ""Reality vs. Expectation"" sequence. The differences between both screens were subtle yet terribly sincere, terribly true. I laughed out loud several times. I enjoyed the active participation and socially savvy relationship pedestals the writers invited me to celebrate & mourn.There was also a healthy blend of realism and fantasy as depicted through the expressionistic personification & musically emotive ""after-sex"" scene. Walking out of his apartment, everything is fresh and vibrant: smiles all around from on watchers. Suddenly it breaks out into song and dance and we're watching ""Zippity Doo-Dah."" It was fun! There were moments where the dialogue was clich Ã but the acting and conceptual vocation held by Gordon-Levitt made it worthy of endurance. Come to think of it, Levitt's on-screen career made some of the clich Ã dialogue wonderfully ironic and that much more compelling.The editing style, again, brought us back & forth through the polar spectrum of emotions: ""She loves me, She loves me not"" syndrome. Frankly, Summer was young and happy-go-lucky; not focusing upon dating labels or destinations, but purely enjoying the ride at Levitt's expense__very obnoxious but true. I guess that's a reflection of my willingness to fully commit in relationships rather than play the part with all the benefits without the labels. Overall, the film worked.

Holy ****.Those are the words that simultaneously grace Tom Hansen's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) synapses just as they explode into a cacophony of euphoria. Left alone to contemplate the implausibility of such a seemingly coincidental happenstance, Tom knows right there that he's in love; that's who he is__foolhardy and quick to romanticise. What he doesn't know however is that she, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) not only doesn't like being someone's girlfriend but that she doesn't believe in love either. Ouch. Like all determined poets however (although, here Tom is a talented aspiring architect rather than some whimsy caricature artist, which is probably for the best), Tom doesn't see how he could fail. Well, he does, but somehow there's just something about Summer that dispels the clouds and offers a ray of hope in return. Ah, poor, na Ã®ve Tom. You really can't help but feel for him.You see, right from the opening scene of 500 Days of Summer, the narration quickly gets across that yes, this is story of boy-meets-girl, but that it is certainly not a love story, even if one of the characters tries to make it so. Rather, it's a story about love, and for all the glimmers of sweet romance and blossoming glints of that ever enigmatic force called love, the story is framed in a manner which constantly reinforces and abides by that opening statement. Told in a narrative that jumps back and forth between the beginning of Tom and Zooey's peculiar development as ""friends"" and some ten months later when Zooey skips town and leaves Tom hanging, 500 Days is no traditional romantic comedy. Indeed, in place of all the formulaic clich Ãs and see-through characterisation lies a somewhat humble and down to earth portrait of a notably off-beat but nevertheless modern relationship. There's comedy, but it's never predictable or banal; there's drama, and yet it never comes off as contrived or overblown; and there's the romance that is sweet, but not sickly so.So what you get, essentially, is a movie that surprises and yet feels conventional on the exact same page. Normally, framing a love story as something that inevitably fails is bad idea with no questions raised, however this isn't the case here. By opening the audience up to the fact that ten months down the line__or, 300 days of 500__Tom is going to be miserable once all the rushing feelings of happiness and comfort take their leave with the leaves that begin to fall from their branches at the closing of Summer's days; by opening the viewer up to this fact immediately, the audience is left to wonder ""well, what is going to happen that causes that seemingly infallible partnership to wither and die?"" Of course, Summer's admission is that it's just life; it's what happens, and it always does__and that is essentially the bitter truth behind much of 500 Days of Summer's first two acts.As the movie progresses however, the central timeline which is told from Day One when Tom meets Summer where he works as a greeting card writer gradually gets closer and closer to the point where that ominous cloud of impending doom is right over Tom's head. From here, much of the story is told in a linear, ""what will happen now?"" fashion. Thankfully, the third act stays true to that which comes before in that it stays grounded and realistic without succumbing to predictable Hollywood staples that one expects when going into a romantic comedy. And that's not to say that the movie ends on a down-beaten note either__rather it's even more cathartic and satisfying than your average feature would indulge you with. Again, you're surprised, but at the same time more than comfortable with this change of perspective, and that's key to 500 Days' ability to feel refreshing and poignantly touching.When it comes to casting, director Marc Webb and casting director Belasco hit the nail on the head with his two leads. Zooey Deschanel, who is fast becoming one of my favourite actresses of recent years plays a roll not at all dissimilar to much of her previous works in these genre films, but that's no coincidence at all. There's something about her eyes that just jumps off the screen with every little movement, and Webb capitalises on this at every moment possible, building up the architecture of Tom's inescapable destiny with all but the slightest glimpses in his direction from Summer. Tom Hansen has a much more complex role opposite Zooey in that he goes through many different passages throughout and has to offer the movie warmth that is notably low-key and downplayed in Deschanel's character. For the most part, he pulls it off well, yet it is in his scenes with his co-star that both really shine__so much so that when the movie's romance begins to unravel by the second act, the pity that Webb attempts to emote from the audience is palpable and as effective as it should be.In the end however, the success of 500 Days of Summer largely comes down to the character of Tom and how he goes through one of the most defining points of his life. Refusing to dupe the viewer into a false sense of security, Neustadter and Weber's script indulges in the nuances associated with the often dubious and hopeless endeavours of looking for love with simplicity and heart-felt pathos as a pacemaker. Beating back and forth between The Smiths and Regina Skeptor, and flowing with a subtle restraint and subdued sense of reality imposed by director Marc Webb in his cinematic debut, 500 Days of Summer is a romantic comedy that exists to the viewer as a bittersweet reminder that boy-meets-girl doesn't always end up as a love story, at least, not the way you expect it to be.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net) ","  loves  Smiths.

Summer is very honest right from the beginning about their relationship. She does not want what Tom wants. She believes in destiny and living a married life with someone she was destined to be a soul mate.

But then when Summer leaves Tom he realizes she believes in what she says. When he meets her after a few days , he is surprised that she is married, pregnant and totally content.

(500) Days of Summer,312,pyrocitor,31/Aug/09,9,7.185678751008357e-08,film not comedy funny even best way life love just director enough drama only entertaining without many ever something real sense character romantic moving far hollywood music moments,0.333333333,3.0,inf,inf,0.0," How to reinvent the romantic comedy? Filmmakers either bold or foolish enough to attempt such a seemingly impossible challenge have struggled throughout the ages, floundering over the delicate balance between credibly depicting the trials and tribulations of romance while simultaneously satisfying the cathartic desire for a romanticized, happy Hollywood ending. The key, it would seem, as with prior success Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, lies in the filmmaker's daring to strive beyond obvious emotional satisfaction, even to the point of the protagonists' interactions not ending in a happy ever after. And in this regard, (500) Days of Summer proves a similarly rich and rewarding experience, all the more funny, entertaining and profoundly true through its toying with or outright disregard for the worn to death formula, demonstrating the definitive way to deliver a comedy or drama about romance. Rather than using the eventual breakup as a surprise tragic twist, director Mark Webb instead eschews formula by simply presenting the relationship between Tom Hansen and Summer Finn, from start to finish, early, awkward flirtations to subsequent, devastating parting, capturing moments which are happy, sad and just plain strange. Which, of course, proves the ideal cocktail, as Webb's film sparkles with life and the sort of inventive genius in editing and cinematography which only a background in music videos could yield. Webb allows his film to mirror the emotional state of the protagonists both visually and tonally, bubbling with spontaneous dance numbers and animated Disney birds to convey Tom's early euphoria, later fuming with moody artistic scribbles, parallelling the trauma and existential grief of a break up, and eventually the quiet, reflective calm which comes with moving on. It is a remarkable feat to travel such an emotional roller-coaster without feeling swept away in maudlin, excessive sentiment, but Webb's film, despite its inevitable forays into magic realism and storytelling coincidence, feels all the more crushing credible and honest because of its overtly cinematic touches rather than in spite of them. Even more helpful is the wry, irreverent sense of humour peppering the film throughout, with sly touches such as the sardonic narrator and fleeting, winking breaches of the fourth wall seeming to assure viewers throughout, preventing the emotional extremes from ever becoming excessively dour, or descending into mawkish indie cuteness. Completing the delightful package is Webb's sublime collection of soundtrack choices, serving to effortlessly fill in the emotional gaps when words or actions simply cannot capture the sheer essence of the situation. Of course, despite the cinematic mastery on display, proper casting is essential for a successful relationship film, and in this respect, Webb achieves another triumph. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is flat out remarkable as unabashed romantic and optimist Tom, perfectly carrying the film with unshowy charisma, and an achingly credible emotional resonance, whether thrilled or crushed. However, Tom is not a romanticized hero, and Gordon-Levitt is just as game demonstrating his self-destructive wallowing, creating a more balanced and believable piece of characterization. Equally impressive is Zooey Deschanel as the titular Summer. Just as careful to humanize a potential spite-worthy caricature, Deschanel instead harnesses her trademark luminous quirkiness into something far more real, harder to outright love but impossible not to empathize with. Providing welcome support to the lead couple's flawless chemistry, Geoffrey Arend and Matthew Gray Gubler deliver welcome laughs as Tom's hapless best friends, and character actor Clark Gregg steals many a scene as an overly sentimental greeting card company editor. Delightful, charming, traumatic and eventually hopeful, (500) Days of Summer proves the rare 'romantic comedy' (to use the term extremely loosely) or drama which is just as likely to appeal to unhappy singles as happy couples. Offering a slice of rare realism, all the more credible through its fantastic and cinematic trappings, Webb's film is a rare marvel which should not be missed, if only for the sake of redeeming a genre bogged down in painful clich Ã and falsities. -9/10 ","   reinvent  romantic comedy?

In the end, a very enjoyable film, with more to it than it seems.We have seen several of this type of movie come out in the last few years, exploring the relationship between adolescents/young adults. Some have cleverly integrated humor, some exciting tunes, and a couple of clever twists to the same old story. Here, we are given plenty of charm, through its two amazing leads, combining good, realistic dialog, with tributes to the old films, where falling in love was enough to set off fireworks, spontaneous dancing, and well, at times, some slapstick. Also, there are tributes to some of the most ""romantic"" films out there, where people sit on benches at stare at the newly found beauty of their surroundings while in their romantic bliss. Yet, there are also warnings about the whole, silly thing along the way.There is pain and joy, love and hate, disappointment, bitterness, cynicism, and plenty of emotions going around in this film. There is enough to give even the smallest speaking part a great line. It is a terrific little movie that move us and makes us think, that can awaken in us some of the reactions that turned some films into classics. This is the type of movie that has been adapted to contemporary times to make it fresh, and yet it retains enough of the classic ingredients to show us how some stars are born, and what real chemistry feels like.This is a film that caters to an audience with intelligence, with the ability to decide and choose, who can truly appreciate interesting cinema. There have been some very good films before, and for some reason John Cusack keeps popping in my head. Gordon-Levitt gives us a little more vulnerability and there less cynicism in his approach, and there is his counterpart, the dazzling Zooey Deschanel, with those amazing eyes that can speak volumes in one look.Enjoyable, touching, and quite an interesting film.

I think they're unoriginal and boring. However, there have been some good romantic comedies especially the ones that focus more on the comedy and less on the romance. The exception with 500 Days of Summer is that it is told in the male's point of view and that was what was most intriguing to me. This was what distinguished the movie from any other brainless romantic comedies that might as well star Sandra Bullock, Kate Hudson or Matthew McConaughy. 500 Days of Summer was described as an anti romantic comedy. It's not a love story, but a story about love and I think that's why it's so appealing.The main character is Tom, played by Joseph Gordon Levitt, meets Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel who Tom believes to be the one. We learn that Summer doesn't believe in love, but Tom does and that can be used to frustrate Tom or anyone watching the film because it is in his point of view.The movie follows the 500 days that they spent together in no particular order. The movie literally starts a 488 and then jumps to day 1 then to 250 then to 4. It sounds like it's going to confusing but it actually wasn't. The story is going to jump all over the place and you have to be aware that this is going to happen quite frequently. This is what keeps the movie creative and original.The performances in the movie were outstanding. Joseph Gordon Levitt definitely surprised me in this whole because I haven't seen him act in anything that wasn't comedic before. I recently saw him in GI Joe as the main villain and thought he gave a terrible performance. But in this I was able to care about his character and feel all of his emotions. Zooey Deschanel also surprised me. The last movie I saw her in was Yes Man, in which I thought that she gave a lazy performance and appeared like she wasn't paying attention for some reason. She plays the character effectively because you start off liking the character and then by the end, you will think she's evil. It's not that often that a I can change my opinion of a character so quickly, but she pulled it off. The only other performances that are worth mentioning are the Tom's coworkers who were there to support him and be humorous, even though their not big name actors. None of their jokes fell flat for me and I was constantly laughing at them. I didn't expect the movie to be so funny.It was directed by Marc Webb and 500 Days of Summer is actually his first film. He actually used to do music videos and he even uses that skill in the film. Half way in to the movie there's a very well choreographed dance scene where everyone is dancing in the streets that felt like a music video. When this part comes in the movie it's very unexpected, but it is very funny to watch.The main problem with romantic comedies is usually a bad script. That's not the case here because everything is so clever and intelligent, that it's so delightful to watch. It's written to be more realistic. When they first meet, it is very awkward and that would usually be what would happen in real life. The script writers previously wrote The Pink Panther 2, which shows that they must not be consistent because that was terrible and dumb. Hopefully, they'll be able to top this film because it was excellent and for a first time director, it's a big achievement.There's one scene in particular that I really enjoyed. Tom was attending a party and was imagining his expectations for it. For an entire 3 minute scene, there is a split screen with the right side showing expectations and the left side showing the reality. It's very interesting to pay attention to both screens and this is the originality I'm talking about.To conclude this review, I'm going to give 500 Day of Summer a 10/10. I think it was one of the best films I've seen all year and the best romantic comedy I've ever seen period. I really hope it gets nominated for a Best Picture. I think everyone should see it because it's too good to miss and I know people aren't going to give it a chance because it's an independent movie and it's not playing everywhere, but I recommend it even if you just want to be put in a good mood for 90 minutes.

The acting was excellent. But, the ending brings this down from a 9 to a 7. The ending was just a downer and overly unrealistic. Sure, most romantic comedies have some lack of realism but Summer's character became very inconsistent; her personality just changed. From a fun-loving person to being bummed out about who she was with - to then enjoying their company again - right before they get engaged? If you are dating someone (which I'm not, I'm happily married) and go to this movie - it will put a lot of pressure on a relationship if people get into this. I would not have been comfortable if I had been dating a girl and took her to this movie. Ironically, the very thing the character in this film criticized (""falling in love"") is what happened. And, it is ultimately unrealistic. Marriage is not sustained by the feeling of love or that ""one moment where you know that is the person."" But, Hollywood continues to propagate this message. Love that makes a marriage last is commitment in spite of one's lost ""feelings"" - feelings fluctuate all the time (of course, in Hollywood, when feelings fluctuate - well, it's time to move on to the next girl or guy).

""I'm not looking for anything serious"" Zooey Deschanel's Summer warns Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Tom at the beginning of their relationship. Both the audience and Tom absorb this, but at the same time ignore it, and the revelation of its truth takes both the audience and the main character for one hell of a turn. Far from the chick flick it may seem to be, 500 Days of Summer is an incredible insight into male infatuation and perception that promises to be the indie hit of the year (think this years Juno).The style of the movie is quite original, especially for those expecting a standard romance fare, so just go see the movie and don't read the reviews if at all possible.500 Days begins around day 300, where Summer breaks up with Tom. This leaves 200 days for this to turn around though, right? We then revert right back to day 1, and continue to jump around in time over the 500 days span, from their first meeting in an elevator listening to the Smiths to their conflicting visits to IKEA and such.It reminds me in a sense of the brilliant Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which by the way I cannot recommend enough. The perception of Tom is what we see, and while it seems that many instances are romance clich Ãs, when it is (through choreographed dance) made clear that the movie is through Tom's eyes and not a third party, we start to look below the surface of what is being shown. Failed relationships are not remembered as they actually happened, and the movie plays with this to a considerable extent.The leads make this journey incredibly believable. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, through movies like Brick and The Lookout, has become one of my favourite actors out there right now (3rd Rock was a looooong time ago). He should be immediately identifiable for most guys, and decently lovable for most girls. His performance is nothing short of exceptional for the genre. Deschanel is also spot-on perfect as the girl who knows what she likes but has no idea what she wants.I must give a brief praise for the soundtrack. The karaoke scenes make amazing use of The Pixies and The Clash (points for the most proper use of Train in Vain ever), and the inclusion of Wolfmother near the end is, for lack of a better word, awesome (yeah, thats right, Wolfmother in a ""romance"").Do not fear the chick flick, 500 Days of Summer is amazing and very thoughtful. I fear somewhat that people expecting a chick flick will view it as a downer and guys won't see it because it wears the clothing of romance, 500 Days is the best movie of its kind I've seen since Eternal Sunshine, and by all means is a must-see.

Nominate her for a Best Actress Oscar for just prettiness magnetism alone. 62nd minute- Zooey is not just an ""acquired taste"" bombshell but she also delivers a restrained but accurate performance as Summer, the greeting card administrative assistant which Tom romances even though she does not reciprocate the same romantic stance towards him throughout most of the relationship. 34th minute- How cool! An entertaining Karaoke scene in the movie, you just don't get enough of good ones in movie scenes these days. 80th minute- Director Mark Webb's definitely has me caught up in his atypical web of developing a romance with a foreseeable breakup where boy is much more into it than girl, we as male species have all been there.

Alert!) 81st minute- Scott Neustadter & Michael Weber's super clever screenplay of this movie is my favorite so far this year in that department. Man, I know I could have revealed my feelings for that in a more witty fashion. I was just flabbergasted with the verbal wit of Scott and Michael's screenplay which has left me relatively punless. 66th minute- Feeling the thespian love of the commendable supporting performances of Geoffrey Arend as Tom's greeting card colleague & pal McKenzie and Clark Gregg as Tom's evenhanded supervisor Vance. 53rd minute- I hope I get at least a semi-nude glimpse of Zooey's left breast in this sex scene between Tom & Summer. 95th minute- ""500 Days of Summer"" will most certainly be in my Top 10 List at year's end!

As for me, as I headed to my car after the show, I imagined how all the passing drivers must think I'm a strange duck, I had such a goofy smile plastered to my face. I couldn't help it: if happiness itself could be taken and made into a movie, (500) Days of Summer would be the result.I'll start with the screenplay. The nonlinear narrative structure allows for suspense (even when there seemingly shouldn't be) and plenty of laughs thanks to clever juxtapositioning of similar scenes happening at opposite ends of the relationship. The on screen counter, introductory paragraph, and final line all are fine examples of the offbeat but accessible wit which defines the film. The use of music is also fantastic; screenwriters sometimes are afraid to write specific songs into their screenplays for fear of seeming like they're trying to direct the movie, but every musical choice here is pitch-perfect (thus, my recent Amazon order for the soundtrack and newfound appreciation of Hall and Oates).I also really appreciated the unique visuals, whether it involves animated elements, split-screen, or black and white. The latter is used when the film breaks styles, becoming an artsy European film or a documentary, and it adds even more to the film's charm. I love when a movie can use interesting visuals to complement a solid foundation (such as Eternal Sunshine or The Fountain), and that's definitely the case here.Of course, a wonderful screenplay and cool visual tricks wouldn't do much for a romance if the leads weren't up to the task. Both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are extremely likable and funny in their roles. Their chemistry is subtle and believable, and they really deliver an exciting arc. I definitely found myself rooting for the relationship, even with the promise of it not working out.The thing that really cemented this film into a spot on my favorites list was the dance scene. I don't want to go into detail for fear of spoiling it, but the snippets in the trailer don't even begin to show the pure joy I received from watching that hilarity unfold. So brilliant.Basically, don't miss this movie. I drove an hour and a half to see it, and am seriously considering making the drive again.

There are moments where the joy is so visceral that you have to smile, and moments of despair that cause an opposite visceral pain. Joseph Gordon Levitt's Tom Hanson is you head over heels with a girl who isn't, and if you're a guy you've been there at least once. Zooey Deschanel's Summer Finn is what makes Tom the greeting card writer believe in the love he's been writing about. Summer comes across as someone you want to know and fit into your adolescent fantasies of love, but you never get to know because you're too busy imagining your lives as one big movie. And this is one big movie.Music is very important here, and the soundtrack is excellent. The relationship is started because of The Smiths ""There Is A Light That Never Goes Out"", and Summer is Tom's light that doesn't go out through those 500 days, even when his meals consist of Whiskey and junk food. Summer loves Ringo Starr the most out of the Beatles, and her favorite song is Octopus's Garden (Not your average John Lennon junkie), yet even when he tries to connect with her by showing her a Ringo solo record its too forced to work.There are funny moments here too, even in the frequent brooding. On a date with a new girl there is ex-embellishing followed by drunken karaoke that is so horribly real you have to laugh. And you hope that when Tom's boss offers him to write sympathy cards when his love writing turns to expletives it could be real somewhere.It makes sense that after 500 days of loving Summer something has to come next, and while the rest of the movie looks back at the past the ending is so open you wonder what will happen next in your own life.

After watching the high romance of Ben's glass-banging at the church that was holding Elaine's wedding, Tom saw what he wanted to see, and never reorientates himself to the calm after the commotion, in which the moment of undying love quickly dissolves by the time both the graduate and the runaway bride find their seats. And then he might have played something by The Smiths as reinforcement of his identification with the wildly-in-love Benjamin. Tom was young. But years later, in a greeting card company boardroom, Tom wakes up from his romantic stupor, and accuses, in particular, pop music and film, of conspiring to break our hearts with an idealism that doesn't transcend its artistic boundaries. Before this epiphany, however, Tom meets Summer(Zooey Deschanel) and he loves her, just flat out loves her. And even though a grown man should know better, Tom is still a hopeless romantic, so he projects the crazy adolescent love expressed in a couplet like ""and if a double-decker bus crashes into us/to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die""(from The Smiths' ""There Is A Light That Never Goes Out""), onto the bus that transports the distracted couple at the end of the Mike Nichols film, when the truth couldn't be any more self-evident. This misreading of ""The Graduate"" comes back to haunt Tom, late in ""(500) Days of Summer"", as life imitates art, in a scene where the greeting card writer finds himself on a bus with Summer after attending a wedding(a co-worker's wedding). With the memory of having seen ""The Graduate"" with Summer still fresh in his mind, Tom confuses expectations with reality, and takes her willingness to sleep against his shoulder as a sign of reconciliation, of love. It's the movie in his head where Dustin Hoffman and Katherine Ross live happily ever after, come to life; somehow ignoring the fact that ""The Graduate"" had made Summer weep and was the catalyst for their break-up. Since ""(500) Days of Summer"" is devised in a non-linear fashion, when Tom shows up at Summer's party, the audience is unaware that he had a second chance at rectifying his original childhood interpretation of 1967 love, incidentally, the summer of love, as the diegesis goes split screen, expressing in formal terms, Tom's expectations(shaped by his naive readings of ""The Graduate""), and Tom's reality(shaped from a corrective reading that his adult self never made, which would comply with the consensus reading of ""The Graduate""). Fueled by love songs from the ""creme de la creme"" of post-punk bands who rose to prominence during the mid-to-late-eighties, Tom envisioned Ben and Elaine as soulmates, in spite of the overwhelming evidence that they were not built to last. To him, ""There Is A Light That Never Goes Out"" is practically a commandment that lovers stay in love. But at the shindig, Summer breaks this commandment irreparably, when Tom sees his one and only showing off her engagement ring to a friend, causing the ""reality"" side to push the ""expectations"" side out of frame, right to left. It's the same direction that Ben takes on the moving airport walkway, famously, in the opening scene of the Nichols film, famous because most filmic movement goes left to right. Now that Tom has finally grown up, he stops espousing his belief in fate and predestination that lives inside the pop song, which had kept him in a perpetual state of adolescence. Now he knows why Summer cried at the end of ""The Graduate"". Elaine didn't love Ben. If Tom conceded the truth on this matter, he'd have to admit that Summer didn't love him too. Played by Zooey Deschanel, it's plain to see why Tom had kept his Smiths goggles on to induce a state of vertigo, because who would want summer to end with a woman like that?

All I can assume is that the people who gave the film a 9 or a 10 saw a different movie from the one I viewed in Rochester's Little Theatre.What I saw is a man, Tom Hansen, portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is madly, truly in love with Summer Finn, played by Zooey Deschanel. OK--Deschanel has big, beautiful blue eyes, and lustrous dark hair. Right--very attractive. Is she intelligent? Not very. Is she kind and caring? Not very. Is she compassionate? Not very. Is she attracted to Tom? Not very.So, we're subjected to 90 minutes of Summer jumping into bed with Tom, all the while telling him that she just wants to be good friends. I guess that's sort of romantic, and it's sort of funny, so technically that makes 500 Days a romantic comedy. It's just not very romantic or very funny.In addition, just to bring the hilarity to a boil, we get Tom's friends, who are a Greek chorus of losers, and Tom's precocious kid sister, who dispenses worldly wisdom in spare moments while she's playing for her junior varsity soccer team.My suggestion--if you want a really good romantic comedy, rent ""Must Like Dogs,"" or ""Sleepless in Seattle.""

From the opening screen, which offers a very funny disclaimer, it is clear that 500 Days of Summer dares to be different. And as the opening sequence clearly states, it is not a love story. Except that's only a technicality. It really is. Sort of.Writers Scott Neustadter and Michael Webber, along with director Marc Webber, have put together a charming, fresh and very funny romantic comedy. Summer (Zooey Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) start an office romance when Summer comes to LA from Michigan for an internship at a greeting card company. Tom writes cards, although he quietly aspires to be an architect. Tom is a romantic idealist who has never found his soul mate. Summer is a disillusioned pragmatist who doesn't believe in love. But Summer immediately takes to Tom, Tom is smitten with Summer and their relationship proceeds as so many do in the movies.Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt play their roles well, although it occurred to me more than once that they lacked chemistry. But remember, this is not a love story, which is what makes 500 Days of Summer more realistic and poignant than what we have come to expect from the movies. But it is a refreshing and thought-provoking take on what we often describe as being in love__about taking risks, dealing with disappointments, finding yourself and bumping into fate when you least expect it.The film includes a couple of movie-making devices that some might find distracting. It uses a timeline to tell the story, but jumps forward and back, which still manages to effectively provide a narrative without feeling like a contrivance. In contrast, the film also pays homage to a number of classic movies, including several clips and snippets, which feels out of place and doesn't quite fit.As currently constructed, 500 Days of Summer will get an R rating. If they can edit it to a PG-13, which would be quite easily done, it could do nicely at the box office.Notes from Sundance: At opening night at the Eccles Center, Deschanel commented on how attracted she was to the script. Director Marc Webber made the point that he wanted to shoot on location in LA, but show a bit of the city's architectural heritage, which did very subtly separate 500 Days from typical Hollywood-Indie fare.

I enjoy the movie overall, and do appreciate what it tries to do; but at the same time I think the film desendends into extreme simplifications of what it attempts to ""dissect"" and ""examine"" - love. Joseph Gordon-Levitt really does shine in (500) Days, and Zooey Deschanel is pretty good as well, although I never found her character to be very likable. As much as I'd like to overlook the film's flaws and just fall for the charm of the characters and hilarity of the script, I can't. In fact, some things in (500) Days of Summer I actually find pretentious and others just get on my nerves. Marc Webb directed music videos before going into film, and this was his directorial debut. Unfortunately, it might show just a little too much. The screenplay is packed with silly moments and situations. Some work as great gags. Others, not so much. Gordon-Levitt prancing around the park to a musical number is one that particularly sticks out to me. The scene is intended to show that Gordon-Levitt's character Tom is in love. At first nothing may appear wrong about the scene, the viewer will chuckle, smile (be reminded of Spider-man 3) and continue watching. Later in the movie, when Summer leaves Tom, the film goes into detailing Tom's ""depression period"". Tom wakes up every morning, goes to the convenience store (still in his pajamas) buys Twinkies and liquor and returns to his mess of a house. After watching the movie, I thought about the two scenes I just described: ""In Love"" (dancing and singing), and ""Depression - Not in Love"" (sleeping, drinking, being lazy). Webb tries to show ""love"" though the most obvious and watery way; shoving it our faces rather than subtly showing feelings subtly through the characters expressions, or eyes. In other words, the direction is lazy. I also found the ending of (500) Days of Summer a bit of a cop-out. The film mostly indulges in being ""artsy"" and it certainly has a indie style, which I recognize is what it's going for, but sometimes I found this to be a bit pretentious, and it kind of took me out of the film. The movie is definitely worth watching, It's no masterpiece, but you'll enjoy yourself for sure. There's many, many flaws, but (500) Days is funny, it's sweet and it sort of comes together. If you want some actually good films that examine relationships, I'd recommend the Annie Hall (1977), High Fidelity (2000), Before Sunrise & Before Sunset (1995,2004), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), and 2 Days in Paris (2007).

But I really liked his character in this, maybe it's because I can relate to the protagonist in this movie. What I really enjoyed was that this isn't a straightforward and narrow romantic comedy and the nonlinear narrative structure works really well in this. It's a movie that is film that is easy to relate with and I liked the chemistry between Summer(Zooey Deschanel) and Tom(Joseph Gordon-Levitt).

The lack of chronological order reflects the scatter brained mind Tom Hansen is coping with. You remember Tom and Summer's relationship in the same manner that he does. The adjacent good times versus bad times form a comical parallel that make you laugh in a dark way. Marc Webb's style in (500) Days of Summer is ultimately enticing and has such a unique approach that I was consistently bewildered throughout the course of watching this film. The split frame of ""reality"" versus ""expectations"" enthralls even men who hate romantic movies and touches on a very personal level with anyone who ever had an expectation that was soon crushed by reality. I envy Marc Webb for his creativity and his brilliant execution of this movie.Anyone who claims Summer Finn to be a heartless, terrible person is an imbecile. In an interview, Zooey Deschanel said that the movie was about ""the person before the person you're meant to be with."" And we're not all Paul who date the same girl since 7th grade, the majority of us kiss a few frogs before we find our prince. Unfortunately, Marc Webb makes every girl with a beating heart fall in love with Tom Hansen (and Joseph Gordon-Levitt along with it), so when he is just a frog and not a prince to Summer Finn- you hate her. But that is the beauty of this movie. It is neither cynical nor light-hearted. It is just real. So real that the movie is inspired by a compilation of the writers, etc. personal stories.Some movies you can watch repeatedly because they are not that good- they are just entertaining so you plop yourself on your couch and get fat over popcorn while watching something you can dream about happening. Some movies- like our beloved Joseph's ""Inception,"" are so incredibly amazing it is difficult to watch it more than once. (500) Days of Summer, however, is different. The movie is so amazing and so well done and so full of life and humor and depression that you can watch it as many times you want and never grow weary of it. And that is why it is my favorite movie. That is why it is my inspiration. That is why you should watch every day until you love every character, even the Chinese family in the bathroom.

This film, as noted elsewhere presents a dead relationship, well before its demise. And so for some folks, that death will feel protracted.The pace and editing however make the film nowhere near so anguishing. The movie makers jump across time liberally, helping to juxtapose the sweet and sour parts of a relationship in an often humorous way. This is much better than a film split into halves with a ""He Saw, She Saw"" divide.Many women will enjoy the film as they get to see the man in a relationship suffer (not to be too glib, but I think I'm not too off the mark here.) Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Tom is the inverse of the bad boy girls aren't supposed to love, but they do. Tom is sweet, shy and often nearly as cute as a puppy. And he adores Summer.Many men will like this as Zooey Deschanel's Summer character is cute and a bit of a wounded bird. Yet she also has surprising pluck and crucially she initiates the romance (read sex?) despite Tom's initial awkward cluelessness. Also, her character...like many objects of affection...is not really clearly seen, mysterious and open for projections by Tom (and the male audience/Zooey zealots).Many men and women will like this film as I do think we are set up to hope/look for the whirlwind romance when we are young. Such love is tough to find, much less sustain. Or in this case, tough to architect such love with just one of the two willing to do the heavy lifting. Ah mirage of youth...Anyways, the film here is getting rave reviews, and honestly I found myself carried along with the film mostly. Spoilers start...I am mildly fascinated, if not relieved, by the discussion posted on the boards here that the last meeting with Summer was all in Tom's head. Just a function of his ""actualization"" or what-have-you. More than the season change at the very end though, other parts of the film irked me. For example...1) The savvy little sister. 2) The plate breaking (which led to a sister scene). 3) The greeting card lampooning. Although the solo ovation from his buddy maybe indicated they were lampooning themselves. Nah... The film is just thinner than it feels.I know that Tom's epiphany is what the film is all about, that and the fact that love, like trummerflora, can bloom again.

His life is pretty meaningless until he meets Zooey Deschanel. They share an affinity for The Smiths. They do zany things like pretend that Ikea is their personal living room and generally flirt with each other.It's a pretty good film overall, I was quite surprised I liked this. The writing was pretty sharp and Deschanel who is usually pretty annoying seemed to be a little more restrained in this movie. Gordon-Levitt is good as well. These are probably the types of movies he should be making instead of crap like Killshot where he was almost laughable as a petty criminal.Maybe this the movie which epitomizes everyone's early 20s or at least their post-university life.

It also dealt with a mopey man out of college falling in love with the wrong girl.

(500) Days of Summer,350,KHayes666,07/Dec/09,8,1.214153557409518e-09,movie one not well even can life much love just fun only first made also ever feel action take man get really screen works isnt right plot,0.0,2.0,inf,inf,inf," To anyone that's ever been in love, you know how it feels to have loved and to have lost.With that said, 500 Days of Summer is a chick flick even guys have to sit up and take notice. Why? Because the message the movie sends out explains pretty much life in general.Stuff just happens....yup, how true is that? The plot is a down on his luck greeting card writer named Tom (played brilliantly by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a miserable so and so until he meets the mysterious Summer Finn (also played brilliantly by Zooey Deschanel) and this is where the fun begins.He spends half the movie trying to get with her, a middle portion of the movie with her and pretty much the end trying to get over her. Anyone who's had a woman (or a man) that you can't explain but just can't get over can identify with almost every situation that happens in the movie.I'll give away everything and say right here, that midway through the movie Summer just ups and breaks up with Tom...which drives Tom over the edge into insanity. This insanity also fires him up to leave his crummy job and go into what he really wants to be, an architect. We then find out that Summer has gotten married in the months she's been away from Tom. Which leads us to the end scene which explains pretty much life. Tom is now an architect sitting where he and Summer once hung out and she happens to sit there with him. He then asks how she got married so soon after breaking it off with him and she says ""It just happened"" As much as that made me want to jump through the screen and strangle her, its true....things in life happen you just can't explain. Love works in mysterious ways and this movie is proof. You feel for Tom having to watch the woman he loves fall for someone else so easily, and you feel for Tom trying to rebuild his life. The acting is brilliant, the storyline is brilliant...if not sad and wall-punch inducing. The only downside is that...well there really isn't any because this movie is not claiming to be an action or a thriller.The one and only downside to this movie which prevented it from being 10 out of 10 is when Tom gets into a fight with a jerk at the bar and Summer blames him for it....he's defending your honor sweetie, why be mad at him? I say the highlight is after Summer first breaks up with Tom, he's on a date with another girl and he describes their breakup. ""She took a giant s*it on my face, literally"" Her ""Literally?"" Tom catches himself and says ""No...not literally, that's disgusting!""

Big deal, I live in Phoenix, AZ. We have 500 days of summer every year.Actually the little movie was a big deal. Currently, I am only awarding it 4/5 stars, however, I think this will be one that will grow on me. It's only been a short while since I've seen it, and I can't get it out of my mind.That being said, it did fell forced at times, the side characters were only mildly amusing (his friends were good __ not great, but his sister was so clich Ãd that she was almost hard to watch) and you can tell the movie it was trying to mimic in the opening with the outlined city (and then throughout.) Okay, if you couldn't tell, watch/re-watch the brilliant Juno.In addition, I really want to say Gordon-Levitt did a great job and should be up for an Oscar nom. But, I can barely say he did a good job. He was trying to play a stuck-in-his-past (well, at all times) geek and though he got that down, no real depth or believability came from him. The movie really belonged solely to Deschanel.She was perfect on many levels. Stole every scene, showed growth and depth consistently and had a perfect on screen persona, a genuine charisma that grabbed you as you got to know her. She deserves, at very least, an Oscar nomination for her real-life character.Probably the majority of people go through relationships like Tom and Summer have. It's no spoiler that this relationship was doomed from day one (of 500 __ obviously.) They tell you that less than a minute in. You want it to work out, you yearn for the nerd to get the free-bird (again, literally) girl. However, as previously mentioned, it was not meant to be and one of the most brilliant aspects was the revolution in the closing on why not.I know I've been through a relationship like this. One party believes in fate, that one special, soul-mate (that's me, duh) while the other's skeptical and may not be the true ""one."" It does hurt that both me and Tom share more than the years in an office job trait __ we're both nerds stuck in the past.Nevertheless, back to the movie. We follow their relationship for 500 day, back and forth from day 42 to 303, then to 121. A lot of the comedy stems from these wonderful transitions. Such as, the fantastic dance segment to Tom's mood in another day of 500. (Side note: Spider-Man 3 did pretty much the same thing, following Peter Parker and in his mind a lovely stroll through the city and a vintage song playing. How did a movie that probably spent $500 million less get this kind of scene right?) Like I said before, some of this felt forced, including a Jerry Macguire blow up, but there were a lot of wonderful scenes, a lot of comedy that made me laugh out loud. It is an adult comedy, and even though most of the movie is pretty much ""clear"" (and ""clean"") of today's adult romcoms __ i.e. any Paul Rudd/Seth Rogen/Adam Sandler features, it will remind you, you're not watching a PG-13 film.I definitely would recommend this small movie to mass audiences, if not just for Deschanel. It was refreshing to see an original spin on the romantic movies of current years. A movie that puts a lot of 1970-80s references to people my age (or Tom's and Summer's) without shoving it down our throats. "," 500 Days  Summer?

As a matter of fact, there's nothing typical or clich Ã about this movie at all (apart from maybe the main character's dimwit friends). The tag line, ""Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't."", really sums it up. And it's not only the plot that is unusual for this genre, everything from the witty dialog to the pleasing visual effects is outstanding. Not to mention Joseph Gordon-Levitt - seriously, where has this kid been since 3rd rock from the sun went off air? Glad to see you back, Joe.Tom Hansen (Gordon-Levitt) is working a dead-end job at a greeting card company, biding time while waiting to find the love of his life and live happily ever after. When he meets quirky Summer (Deschanel), he thinks he's found what he's been looking for. And sure, at first things are rosy. Unfortunately for Tom, Summer soon grows tired of the relationship and moves on. Tom doesn't. Plenty of post-breakup hilarity ensues, and whilst feeling for our main boy you also find yourself laughing your pants off. A Valentine's day card reading ""Roses are red, violets are blue - F*** you, w****"" would've come in handy at some point to the best of us, right? The relatively unknown Marc Webb and the brilliant cast manage to create realistic yet highly likable characters, which is so rare to see in a romantic comedy (I'm looking at you, Matthew McCounaghey). The film also has a very natural flow to it, which isn't a given considering the constant leaps in time and oddities like an awesome dancing scene, not to mention the short tributes to old cinema classics. The best part, however, is that despite (or perhaps thanks to) the lack of a fairytale ending, (500) Days of Summer is definitely a feel-good movie. It's really all about moving on, no matter how horrible the heartbreak.So do yourself a favor and drop your prejudices towards the ""romantic comedy""-label. This is a through-out entertaining and enjoyable movie with very few flaws, plus an introduction to what's possibly the funnest game since Twister (you'll see).

The premise of boy meets girl, boy loves girl but girl doesn't love boy appealed to me. There were several things about the film I liked. I'm not a huge fan of Zooey Deschanel, but her quirky and slightly sad portrayal of the commitment phobic, cynical Summer was great. This was a great contrast to the usual heroine in a romantic comedy, beautiful but a bit desperate for love and ending up in a huge stereotype of a relationship. Its refreshing for someone who is also sceptical of romance and true love (despite being in a good long term relationship), some people just aren't romantic like that, and don't feel a need to ""put a label on the relationship"". However, the end of the film drastically let me down. From having her own unique and slightly sad/cynical view on love, suddenly she makes a complete u-turn and gets married without any explanation. What is this for? Are we supposed to take away the exact opposite message to the one we have been given all the way through, that true love does exist and life really is a big stereotype? That said, there are many clever techniques at work, split scene cameras which are pretty effective, some animated or black and white scenes etc. I wasn't impressed by the jumping back and forward in time, but I can see where they are coming from with creating an overall picture. Also, the soundtrack (a lot of Regina Spektor, who at her best is melancholy perfection) is very good. Alternative and effective at creating the right mood. There are some cheesy aspects: the character ""Autumn"" who he meets at the end, being symbolism at its most intelligence insulting. I hate the u-turn in Summer's character/beliefs and I think the ending could have been a lot better/different. That said it has its own kind of beauty and is a good change from the usual Hollywood romantic fodder.

It is funny, touching, well written and very well acted. It thankfully avoids most of the romcom clich Ãs that we are so familiar.The film tells of the 500 days from the first time Tom meets (and instantly falls for) Summer. In this case Tom is the hopeless romantic and Summer goes with the flow but doesn't believe in love. There is a twist by not showing the events in chronological order. So at the start of each scene we see which day of the 500 it is and therefore have a good idea of the stage the relationship is at. So we go back and forth between the good times of the early days to Tom's problems in dealing with the break up and Summer moving on.Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt play the lead characters perfectly. You like them despite their faults and hope things work out well. However it becomes obvious that their relationship is not meant to be but hope they don't get too badly hurt.

Here it is that indie film that since 2006, when Little Miss Sunshine stole our hearts, we have become accustomed to watch: (500) Days of Summer (Marc Webb, 2009).Everything is there. The not-so-famous-but-yet-known actors, the cool music, the mix with art/drawings, the witty dialogs...If that wasn't enough (and it usually isn't), (500) Days of Summer speaks volumes to me. The story is bitter-sweet and romantic, it has a cool soundtrack and better yet there is so much in the script that reminds me of Nick Hornby's books - who happens to be my favourite contemporary English write.But still I can't help but feel that something is missing from (500) Days. That something just doesn't quite measure up to its predecessors.I know it really isn't a fair competition. When you look back, after Little Miss Sunshine three year ago, we were greeted by Diablo Cody's Oscar winning Juno in 2007 and last year we saw the sweet-teenage-flick Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist.So I guess we were a little spoiled, because these three films were actually really good in their own right. They all had something that you could go ""wow, this is actually pretty great"".However, in our 2009 lovely indie film there isn't anything like that. More than that, (500) felt a bit too fake. Everything is so well put together. The dialogues, the costumes, the makeup, the sets__ everything! It really does feel like is fitting some kind of genre box, following a formula, which is not exactly a bad thing, but I think it ends up being pretty boring.Funny enough, in the end none of its shortcomings matters.

Firstly, the relationship portrayed is so 'everyday'. There is no ""Romeo and Juliet""-esquire complete love, or ""Heartbreak Kid"" style dysfunctionality, it is plain normal, and embraces that wholeheartedly. The audience is gifted to two brilliant performances that show how in the beginning of any relationship there is that unmatched fire that blinkers all other feelings and makes everything seem perfect. I applaud both the writers and the two leads for catching this unlike anything I've seen before.Secondly, and more importantly I feel, the real genius is that I came out of the theatre feeling like the film quite easily could have been written about me. And I could tell 90% of the audience had the same feeling. There's no over-dramatisation of events, just those 'blinkers' being removed slowly throughout the film. The line ending ""...I suggest you look again"" is one of the most poignant I've ever heard in this genre. You don't have to have felt real pain or loss in love to understand Tom's (lead male) position; if you've ever been sent mixed messages, messed around a bit, or cannot see how to save your relationship, you connect with him. You can also relate to Summer if you have experience of a relationship where the counterpart is more keen than you. You don't know exactly how to express it, and even when you try to make yourself clear, you end up sending mixed messages and hurting the person anyway.And it's not gender specific, another beauty of the film.Of course, we know from the tag-lines that the usual masculine and feminine roles are swapped, but they're easily interchangeable and anyone in the audience could relate to either side.I struggle to find any other words to explain the genius in this film. I just assure you that if 100 people are in a theatre watching this, 90 of them will relate to it very strongly, and will be touched by this film. If you don't, there's a high chance you have found the 'one' with far too much ease, and so you can laugh at the rest of us anyway. This film has so many messages, I'm quite certain I didn't catch them all, and so know I will enjoy watching it time and time again in the future and being able to relate in a different way each time.

The premise is quite simple: Summer Finn,played by Zooey Deschanel, doesn't believe in true love, and Tom Hansen,played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who does believe,falls for her.Obviously this can't go well. Despite the constant warnings by Summer that she isn't looking for anything serious and does not want a commitment, Tom falls deeper in love with her everyday and as the time goes by the two of them become lovers.However, when asked about it,Summer refuses to put a label on their relationship which leaves Tom with a feeling of unease.One day Summer leaves and Tom is left wondering,how the hell can he move on? The story is presented in a non-chronological format which is the first thing that really makes the film stand out, the way it was edited was absolutely brilliant.Zooey Deschanel gave a solid performance but was definitely out shined by Joseph Gordon-Levitt,who for me is an amazing actor yet very underrated.He's not your typical Hollywood heartthrob leading man but there's something very unique and special about him.The film also has a killer soundtrack, and I really mean it,the songs are beautiful and fit the scenes(and the general ambiance)perfectly! One of the few things I didn't like so much was the ending,I don't want to spoil it but it is kind of an happy ending that doesn't feel consistent with the rest of the movie.It doesn't feel very honest.With a different ending this movie could have been almost perfect.Regardless, 500 Days Of Summer is an refreshing movie with two good performances(mainly Joseph Gorden-Levitt) that shows the sweet and sour aspects of romance and deserves to be seen.8/10 ","   great  500 Days  Summer   unlikely  romantic comedies  depicts real life,  not everything goes according  plan,where bad things  happen  people  suffer.  premise  quite simple: Summer Finn,played  Zooey Deschanel, doesn't believe  true love,  Tom Hansen,played  Joseph Gordon-Levitt,   believe,falls  her.Obviously  can't go well.

Tom believes in true love, fate, the ""one"" etc. And Summer the precise opposite.The latest in a line of quirky indie romcoms emerging from the states over the past few years (500) Days of Summer contains many of the key ingredients of its predecessors but displays enough ideas of its own to set it apart. The requisite hip soundtrack and references to music a la Garden State, Juno are firmly in place. The main characters bond over the Smiths, sing Pixies at a karaoke night and declare mutual love for Bruce Springsteen. The film opens with with vignettes briefing us on Tom and Summer's childhood complete with a wise sounding narrator, so far so Wes Anderson.Taking place over 500 days the film plays fast and loose with its structure jumping freely between the first encounter, the last days and everything in between. This allows for some clever running jokes and never becomes incoherent. The film comes really alive with several set pieces seemingly taking place in Tom's head. Highlights include a split screen juxtaposition of expectations and reality during a party at which Tom hopes to win Summer back and a full on song and dance number perfectly illustrating Tom's elation after his first physical encounter with Summer.The supporting cast are all a bit two dimensional (Tom's knowledgeable 12 year old sister is just annoying) but the film is all about the two leads. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great, revelling in a role that lets him flex his comedic and emotional chops, whilst Zooey Deschanel is as enigmatic and sweet to the audience as she is for Tom.Not perfect but one of the funniest and sweetest films i've seen this year.

At first glance, it seems like director Marc Webb went into the 500 Days of Summer project rather half-heartedly and without fully understanding just how to market a big summer rom-com.However, woe-betide you if from these rather uninspiring first impressions, you decide not to see it. You may just be missing one of the finest moments of cinema this year.Zooey Deschanel (The Happening) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Halloween H20) star in this wonderful and uplifting tale of a man's journey through the pleasure and of course pains of love and dating.The artistic flair in Webb's direction may, at first be confusing to some, but settle in with popcorn and a cold drink and it soon becomes apparent just how the film is made; making it an unconventional but thoroughly enjoyable portrait of love.The acting from the leads can only be described as lovely, in the blue corner, we have Gordon Levitt's character Tom Hansen; working in a greetings card factory, he dreams of being an architect, though those dreams seem to have outreached his grasp. He practically leaps off the screen in a soft, gooey manner, showing perhaps that men aren't as heartless as they are sometimes seen. In the red corner we have Deschanel playing Summer. Her cutesy looks and charming persona make the two actors have a wonderful chemistry, matched by only a few in the past decade.Webb has done exceptionally well turning what could've been a formulaic love story into something interesting, original.

He is also a firm believer in romance and soulmates. One day, his boss hires a new personal assistant, Summer (Zooey Deschanel) and Tom is smitten from his very first glimpse at the dark-haired secretary. His friends and co-workers see his admiration almost immediately and tease him relentlessly but, fairly soon, Summer becomes friends with Tom. However, she makes it clear early on that she is only looking for a casual relationship, nothing serious. Nevertheless, Tom pursues a romance with the lovely Summer, for he believes he can convince her that they are meant to be a forever couple. They go shopping at Ikea together, hike up to their favorite lookout over the city, and see each other often. Tom thinks he has opened a floodgate when Summer actually has him over to her place. But, in a relationship where the level of attachment is so lopsided, can anything good result? This is a comical, sure-fire look at the heartache of unrequited love, one of the best ever. Tom is the epitome of all-consuming love generated toward someone who does not match his affections, not by far. But, its difficult to place blame on someone who makes his or her position known from the start. As the unlikely couple, Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are terrific and all of the lesser cast members are great as well. In addition, the film is inventive and clever, even mixing a bit of animation into the fabric of the movie. What a surprise and a delight this is! The costumes, scenes, script and production values are also very worthy and the direction is surefooted and smooth, a difficult feat when the timeline jumps from past to present and other places in-between at every turn. It only takes one day to acclaim this flick as a top film of 2009 and it would make a wonderful, cathartic view for anyone who has had their heart pulverized, even if its only been a matter of weeks, for the movie also offers seeds of romantic hope for the scorned.

Of the many attractions in Dallas, the Angelika Film Center is quite possibly my favorite. So, after previewing the trailer for Marc Webb's (500) Days of Summer, with my innate love for Zooey Deschanel and finding out the movie was playing at the Angelika one summer night, two friends and I sped off to the DFW on a hot July night, only to be slightly disappointed in our viewing.The plot of (500) Days, even the title itself, is quite deceiving, claiming that it ""is not a love story."" Quite contrarily, (500) Days seems to be an extremely lavish romantic comedy. Though the film has a unique approach to love, it is not for those fateful believers in the idea of romance. The coupled duo, Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, meet ever so fatefully at their card company job, and develop a typical office relationship. Deschanel warns him early she does not want a relationship, while Gordon-Levitt simultaneously falls head over heels for her. The film has many cute relationship activities, such as a karaoke bar scene. However, the script lacks in cathartic appeal, dismissing lovers' everyday conversations.While I felt sorry and sympathized with Gordon-Levitt, I also felt empathy for Deschanel's cold-hearted character. The film makes clear that she intends not to hurt him from the beginning, with a warning, and that he traps himself inside a wormhole of emotion. Gordon- Levitt appears pathetic to the audience, doing anything he can to win Deschanel back, while she becomes involved elsewhere.(500) Days proves that love is not always the answer, and that, while being a fictitious story, two people cannot share the exact sentiment toward each other at the same time. The movie highlights only one situation of love, boy falling for an unattainable goal, and describes the way that no one ever falls the exact same way for anyone else. The closing of (500) Days, though not as completely expected, is the giveaway to the film's trailer claim of its absence of being a typical romantic comedy.The psychological concept that relationships are cyclical deters the overall theme of (500) Days. The meaning of the story is a little hazy, but it has good intentions for ""not being a love story."" The script seems to lack a certain quality of real life, without sentiment, and has an extremely jumpy storyline between reality and the imaginative. I applaud only Deschanel's acting in the film because of its opposition to her normal character: mostly a kindhearted and naive sweetheart.The visual aspects of the film, with bright colors and sunshine in abundance, and the music added to the quality of (500) Days. One scene, depicting Gordon-Levitt's happy-go-lucky attitude after a night with Deschanel, uses blue and turquoise colorful undertones and Hall and Oates ""You Make My Dreams Come True"" to express his innate happiness. I bought the soundtrack on iTunes immediately after returning home.Fans of How to Deal, Love, Actually, and P.S. I Love You will appreciate (500) Days for its one-of-a-kind approach at relationships in their making. However, I would not recommend the film to anyone who has any question whatsoever in their relationship, or for those who see fate as a number one option to finding a person to spend the rest of their life with. After all, nothing lasts forever.

(500) Days of Summer,365,iKramerica-1,31/Aug/09,8,1.311876823138961e-12,film movie one not story good funny even time way life love just may little still look never two only first though people many real doesnt character man get audience worth better really hollywood isnt right dont might,0.0,2.0,inf,inf,inf," Contrary to what popular culture would have you believe, there are many men who believe just as the main character in this movie believes: that there is someone out there for them worth loving and settling down with. This story is told from that perspective. First, the acting and film-making are both fresh. Obviously the two stars are ""who they are"" and act accordingly, but they were the right choice for the roles. Zoey D is always quirky but adorable and hard to ignore, and JG-L is his normal teddy bear likable, and that's good here. Because there is never a time in the film when you are supposed to hate these people, and these two are unhatable, so it works.The style of the film is novel. It's linear in how it presents what you should know at the time, but non-linear in the time-line, showing outcome before setup, or various stages of a relationship in quick succession, using a day counter as a motif over a sketch of changing seasons/weather as a symbolic representation of the mood. Really clever, but not gimmicky in it's cleverness. An entirely different way of playing with time than in Momento, for example, but just as effective.This isn't a movie where the male lead is a playboy and all his friends sit around degrading women all day. Nor is the male lead a loser simply because he's not a woman's man. Nor does he ""get drunk and cheat"" or any other clich Ã.Because that ISN'T how all men are (player or loser or one drink away from infidelity), and this movie acknowledges that and celebrates it. In fact, nobody in the movie is like that. They are just real people. When happy, they are happy. When mad, they may call someone a nasty name, but they don't mean it. When sad, they are sad. It's what real people do.And that's what's so good about this movie. Even though the situation isn't as deep as real life might be, it still resonated with the audience, especially the men, who were laughing at all the endearing parts and the true parts, because we've all been there, where the girl we love just doesn't love us back, but we are too blind to realize it and go through life in a happy daze until we crash and burn. It was almost cathartic to realize how many men had been through that same situation, and hopefully the women in the audience took a look around and saw that men are caring, sensitive people inside, despite what Hollywood usually tells them.Now if only today's filmmakers could learn to pace things a little better. The only reason this movie doesn't get a 10 is because there were 5-10 minutes throughout the film that were slow/redundant, and if the editing were tighter, the film would have been more powerful. It's not as drawn out as an Apatow movie like Funny People or Knocked Up, with entire sections of the movie that should be excised, but it still could have been tighter.Maybe it deserves a 9, considering what gets 10's on IMDb, but I think 8 is pretty damn good.

(500) Days of Summer,367,chris  (highspot),25/Aug/09,8,1.3627798146501798e-16,film movie one not story good comedy well funny time best can way life love make just makes performances director little enough still great two only see first heart also world though many ever real tale often doesnt feel romantic take audience really seen hollywood right might,0.0,2.0,inf,inf,inf," Refreshingly honest and painfully accurate, (500) Days of Summer takes us on a journey that many of us know all too well, that of love gone wrong. As potentially depressing as this premise sounds, director Marc Webb manages to find a beautiful balance between the agonizing lows and giddy highs of love (and the lack thereof) to leave us feeling not depressed as if constantly regretting the one that got away, but satisfied that we managed to have some great times together and actually learned about life and ourselves in the process.As the narrator says within the first few minutes of the movie, this is not a love story. Nor is it truly a comedy. At the same time though, it IS a story about love that is often funny, sometimes tragic and always heartfelt. Joseph Gordon Levitt plays Tom Hansen, a hopeless romantic who believes that true happiness comes with finding the one person in the whole world he is meant to spend his life with. When he meets the enigmatic Summer Finn, played by Zooey Deschanel, Tom soon feels that he has finally met his one true love. Is it fate that Tom and Summer are destined to be together or is fate just an idea manufactured by greeting card companies and the entertainment industry in order to cash in on our apparent need for a happy ending? For that matter is true love anything more than an illusion, a fleeting emotion that fades as quickly as it appears leaving us wondering if it was ever really there at all?Summer certainly doesn't believe in love. Near the beginning of the film we are taken to a little over halfway through the 500 days that make up the time frame of the story and watch as Tom's heart is shattered as Summer reveals that she doesn't think the two should see each other any more and says those insidious words that have crushed the hopes of countless young men... ""You're still my best friend!""The remainder of the movie unfolds as if we are in Tom's mind, jumping back and forth through the 500 days trying to piece together what went wrong and thinking of what can be done to make it right. The entirety of their relationship is seen through Tom's eyes and it really does feel like you're in someone's head as they're dealing with a freshly ended relationship. At first he remembers the good times, the day they met, their first date, their first kiss. All of this reminiscing only makes the reality of the situation worse as we can see the signals that he's either missed or ignored along the way, some subtle like a sideways glance or an awkward pause, others blatant like Summer telling him point blank early on that she's not looking for anything more than friendship. Is there any hope of reconnecting with Summer and creating a happy Hollywood ending?Tom's dilemma is sure to strike a nerve with not only all of us hopelessly romantic guys out there, but anyone, male or female, who has ever been sure of what you want but wanted more than what someone was willing to give. On the flip side, many can probably also relate to Summer who's not sure of what she's looking for but might one day be surprised to find that what she wants wasn't what she thought it would be.Both Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt give fantastically true and subtle performances. Just like any guy falling head over heels for a girl Tom blows certain actions (or inactions) out of proportion to often comedic effect, seeing missed opportunities where there might not be any and seeing deep meaning where there might just be coincidence. Levitt plays it so real though that when Tom is happy you feel his joy and when he's not you feel his anguish. Summer is mostly seen as a thing of mystery and Deschanel plays this perfectly, her reserved demeanor hiding most of what is going on in her head and heart. Instead we can best decipher her feelings through her actions like pulling her hand away from Tom's or her silence and changes in attitude. It's heartbreaking watching Tom try to recapture the feeling of the early days of the relationship knowing that he's on a sinking ship.At the end of the 500 days everyone has learned from their experiences and has grown as a person... this includes the audience. At its best (500) Days of Summer is a cathartic release for anyone who is falling or has ever fallen in or out of love (or thought they had) and leaves you with a bittersweet hopefulness for the next time love sneaks up on you. At its worst this film is a quirky take on a timeless tale with enough genuine laughs and unique direction to make it enjoyable for all but the most jaded movie goer. Like the one that got away, I'll remember (500) Days of Summer fondly both for the joy it brought me in the good times and the things I learned in the bad.

It tells us up front that ""this is not a love story"". Before the opening credits roll, we already feel something for these characters because we know this isn't going to be your conventional rom-com that ends with a wedding and flowers.The romance centers on Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel). Tom bores himself to death writing greeting cards when his true passion lies in architecture, and Summer is the boss' new assistant. Tom falls for her the minute he sees her, and our 500 days have begun.The irony of this relationship is that Tom and Summer are truly opposites. Tom believes in love and fate. He hasn't been very successful in relationships, but he is not discouraged because he is waiting for ""the one"". On the other hand, Summer believes that true love is a myth. In fact, she doesn't even know what love means.At the outset, Summer is clear with Tom that she just wants to be good friends. Reluctantly, Tom goes along with this, not because he agrees with her, but because he thinks he will be able to change her over time. This blossoming romance is presented in non-chronological order, jumping to and from all points in their relationship.The non-chronological presentation is not the only thing that sets this film apart from your average romantic comedy. The script, written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, successful combines both the comedic and dramatic moments. It achieves one of the hardest things for a script to do: to be funny and heartbreaking at the same time. In addition, director Marc Webb, in his feature film debut, shows that he can do more than tell a good story. He uses a variety of creativity to tell the tale, including split-screens, but it is all controlled. He doesn't go over the top and the movie benefits from its 95 minute running time. It is the perfect length to tell a story that bounces around a lot.And then there is the acting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are perfectly cast in this movie and their chemistry is truly genuine. Deschanel has already established herself as a solid actress, and she takes another step forward here. She plays Summer perfectly as a woman who doesn't really want anything more than to just go with the flow. We sense in some scenes with Tom that she is capable of being vulnerable and committed to the relationship, but that side of her is never brought out. On the other side, Gordon-Levitt is not yet a household name, although he is sure to be there soon. He gives another solid performance in this movie, in a role that requires a variety of emotions, from dancing with a cartoon bird, to smashing plates on his kitchen counter. He has an incredibly bright future ahead of him, and he is probably licking his chops after landing a role in the upcoming Christopher Nolan movie, Inception.To find any criticism in the movie, I would say that the narration and the opening credits sequence are a bit quirky and unnecessary. The narration is fine for the opening scene, but as it continues throughout the movie, I didn't really see its purpose. As for the credits sequence, which features childhood photos of Tom and Summer, I just found it completely weird. It's not as if they knew each other when they were children, and this movie isn't supposed to be a true love story, so seeing their childhood photographs just didn't do anything for me.However, these are minor faults, and the film is still completely worth seeing. From top to bottom, from the acting to the script, it's one of the most charming films of the summer. For anyone who appreciates originality, 500 Days of Summer is definitely a must-see.

Naturally, we go back to when they first met, when they became *ahem* intimate, and so on. Although Summer says she isn't looking for anything close, the two get along practically like boyfriend and girlfriend.In addition to the title, the story, and the non-linear timeline, the film shows it's offbeat with whimsical and funny moments like a scene that depicts reality and fantasy at the same time. Luckily, these moments only happen occasionally, so they don't draw too much attention to themselves. The movie is clearly more concerned about character development. There are lots of other funny moments surrounding conversations ( Ã¸ la ""Knocked Up"") and everyday-like incidents.""(500) Days of Summer"" is really well acted. While watching it, I didn't even think about the acting. I thought of the characters as if they were real people. That's acting at its best. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, particularly, continues to amaze me, as he did in ""Mysterious Skin"" and ""The Lookout"". If he doesn't get nominated for an Oscar for this film, he should be in the near future.Unfortunately, the ending is somewhat predictable and maybe even a tad unrealistic.

(500) Days of Summer,372,Chris Knipp,19/Jul/09,8,1.295283026447426e-13,film one not story good comedy well even films time best can way much love just may movies still fun new never two only heart made also though without many ever real doesnt sense character romantic man get audience better screen works long hollywood right dont,0.0,2.0,inf,inf,," (500) Days of Summer is a romantic comedy with a new approach. What is original is not the indie mannerisms of this Sundance hit -- the references to groups like The Smiths, the meet-cute at a greeting card company, the tendentious voice-over, or the jumbled chronology, but the fact that the couple doesn't live happily ever after. This is the story of a love affair that goes south. It's made clear right off the bat that the wooing of Summer (Zooey Deschanel) by Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) led to disappointment for Tom. With its downbeat story arc and only mildly hopeful finale, Days defeats genre expectations. But it still works within a highly conventional framework.And so you'd better like the stars. The faces of Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel dominate the screen. Indeed they seem a cute and well-matched couple, the reedy, deep-voiced Gordon-Levitt, with his buttoned-down appearance and mobile face, and the winsome, wide-eyed Deschanel. Gordon-Levitt has the more interesting and challenging role. He runs a gamut of emotions, beginning interested and doubtful when Summer becomes the boss's assistant at the greeting card company where he works; then growing hopeful, falling in love, walking on air (even doing a song and dance number with a movie-musical chorus line) after they finally have sex, playful and delighted; then despairing, hopes dashed, numbed, drunken; and briefly hopeful again after a separation when Summer walks away from Tom and her job, and they meet once more on the way to a wedding, she invites him to a party, and he thinks they'll get back together. Gordon-Leavitt is good: he's always working, and it never shows.Deschanel is less interesting to observe. Her character is bland and elusive. Summer seems to alternate only between giving in and pushing away. It's hard not to think, if you're a man, that Summer's a terrible tease; that she breaks Tom's heart without a qualm. Didn't she say she just wanted to be friends? Yes, she did. So from the female viewpoint, Tom is pushy and adolescent. He doesn't listen. But then why does Summer engage with Tom in experimental shower sex and humorously play house with him at Ikea? He's a romantic who believes in destiny. The twist is that Summer is converted to a belief in these things by finding a man, but that man is not Tom. Meanwhile the failure of his romance with Summer has shattered Tom's romantic illusions. One good thing comes out of it for him: he can't write cheery jingles anymore and goes back to pursuing a career as an architect.Deschenel has had many roles in films, but they linger mostly on notes that are winsome and fey; she's the Hollywood quirky deadpan girl (notable efforts are All the Real Girls, The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy , and Tin Man). Gordon-Leavitt, on the other hand, has shown daring and skill in the range of roles he's played in Manic (a violent, disturbed youth), The Lookout (a brain-damaged sports hero who turns to crime), Latter Days (a homophobic Mormon) Mysterous Skin (a gay hustler), Brick (a high school detective), and Stop-Loss (a gung-ho young soldier). He's been good in all of these and they've been interesting films. The conventionality of this relatively mainstream rom-com role in (500) Days of Summer is, paradoxically, a new challenge for him. Deschanel, who definitely had a fresh appeal when she started out, has chosen some notably dubious films to be in, such as Elf, Failure to Launch, Yes Man, and The Happening. Though fans of Deschanel say this is one of her best parts, both the actress and the writing of her character weaken the film. Snapshots of previous lovers aside, Summer has no background, her job is undefined, and we don't get to know her friends. The cute but recessive Deschanel doesn't emerge as a clearcut personality.Despite the twist of the negative ending, the more you think about (500) Days of Summer the more conventional it seems. Its worst element is its gratingly insistent shifts back and forth in time over the famous 500 days, signaled by an on screen clicker whose specificity (day 442, day 3, day 157, whatever) doesn't keep it from being ultimately numbing and confusing. If you can keep all these numbers in your head, good for you; but the shuffling seems anything but enlightening. Sure, it's meant to convey the mosaic of feelings a tangled relationship leaves behind in he memory of the victim. But it's also a needless distraction, a ""modernist"" device to keep the audience busy but a sign the filmmakers neglected the harder job of crafting a coherent narrative. A reversed or jumbled chronology is a clich Ã by now. The only enlightenment we get from this one is a sense of the obvious: that sometimes things were going well between Tom and Summer, and sometimes they weren't. And that Summer always saw things differently from Tom, because he fell in love and she knew all along he wasn't the one.Something utterly routine is the pair of buddies who'd like to advise Tom but can't because the nerdy McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) is a perpetual loser with the ladies and the chiseled-cheeked Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler) has been with the same girl since elementary school. The only difference from convention is that they aren't comical or tricksters as in films like 40 Days and 40 Nights or Knocked Up.But while the latter two movies may be more fun, (500) Days of Summer, despite my reservations, is enjoyable viewing because of the cute couple that charms you and the heartbreak that touches you. Cuteness and charm and heartbreak, if you don't intrude on them too much, go a long way, and even the convoluted time-scheme can't obliterate them. But if Marc Webb and writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber sought to reinvent the wheel, they still came up with the familiar round utensil.

They enter a relationship but she is reluctant to commit to anything serious. She's been burnt by past relationships and no longer believes in commitment, whilst he is a romantic who believes in ""true love"", ""destiny"" and ""love at first sight"".""500 Days of Summer"" has been praised for its ""originality"", but its really just a formulaic romantic comedy wrapped up in some simple role reversals. Usually the commitment-phobe is the male, but here it's Summer, who from the very outset warns Tom that she is merely looking for an empty sexual fling.But though the film's humour never rises above sitcom level, ""500 Days of Summer"" does boast another interesting performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Levitt, who has churned out a series of great performances in such low budget independent movies as ""Brick"", ""Manic"", ""Mysterious Skin"" and ""The Lookout"", looks set to become a major A-list actor with his recent casting in Chris Nolan's ""Inception"". His introspective acting style, his quiet sexuality, his brooding characters, make him far more attractive than the usual one dimensional Hollywood poster boys.The most interesting thing about the film, though, is the screenwriter's choice to portray Tom as an architect. Writers love to write themselves into their films, and often base their scripts around incidents and emotions that they personally experienced in real life. Scott Neustadter, the writer of ""500 Days of Summer"", himself admits that this screenplay was based on a real romance he had several years ago. But because writing is a solitary, visually boring occupation, with many negative connotations wrongly attached to it (writer as introvert, drunk, brooding, lonely, hostile, outcast etc), screenwriters often like to place themselves in their stories via the slightly more ""glamomerous"" art-form of ""architecture"". They see architecture as a sort of respectable cousin to writing. The use of architecture in this way has a long tradition in film, popping up in everything from crap like ""Indecept Proposal"" to ""There's Something About Mary"" to more prestigious fare like ""Don't Look Now"" and ""The Fountainhead"".What's unique about ""500 Days of Summer"", though, is that the lead hero is both a writer (he writes greeting cards) and an architect who learns to turn his back on writing (which he associates with lies and ugliness) whilst embracing architecture (which he associates with beauty and truth). The irony is that once he embraces architecture, with all its structural beauty and clean lines, he finally learns to appreciate the truth, beauty and power of words.Anyway, in the real world all artistry has long been eradicated from architecture. In Europe especially, architecture is now a dead art, architects living in a world where every building is subject to government regulations and strict design codes. In the UK, for example, you can't make even the simplest modification to your home (which are all, on average, over sixty years old) if the government deems it to be too outlandish, too ""upseting"". A simple garage or conservatory extension is often denied by the local government, who deems such things to be ""too obtrusive"" to the ""style"" and ""chacteristics"" of other homes in the area. Today architecture is only alive and vibrant in places like the Middle East, where heavy industry is on the rise and space is plentiful. 7.5/10 - This is an above average romantic comedy which, because of its excellent final scene, has managed to leave an overly positive final impression on audiences.Worth one viewing.

The infinitely superior (500) Days Of Summer could be pitched in a very similar way as it attempts to exchange typical gender character traits.

Enter Zooey Deschanel as the beautiful yet distant Summer who firmly upholds the belief that love is a myth and is considerably better off without the emotional baggage a relationship brings. One is smitten, the other interested yet coolly detached.Whilst Zooey's performance is inarguably great (good enough to forget about 'The Happening' thank god), the film is centred on Tom and Gordon-Levitt is instantly likable and effortlessly carries the picture; a good job as there is barely a scene with out him. Whilst he is 'the sensitive type', he's not effete or sappy but instead familiar and convincing - your firmly on his side.What transpires is a unique, realistic and entertainingly insightful movie with a great (if a little over-used) soundtrack.

(500) Days of Summer,380,Doctor_Mongoose,02/Sep/09,8,3.844630254962851e-07,film one story comedy well films way life much love makes work new only see ever often romantic really works far seen hollywood isnt,0.25,4.0,inf,inf,inf," Before I watched 500 days of Summer I didn't really know too much about it. I had seen the trailer that had spruced it up to be a quirky yet throwaway romantic comedy, yet in reality the film seemed to have much greater aspirations.The story revolves around this bloke and his obsession with his boss's new secetary, taking us through the story of their relationship in an interesting non-linear way. The non-linear storytelling is only a fraction of the dollops of style that is thrown in the direction of the film. Some of it works perfectly fine, adding an interesting extra dimension to the film, however it seems in places some of the style that was thrown ever so liberally completely misses and ends up getting stuck in your eye, leaving you fidgeting awkwardly wishing it wasn't there.For the most part the story is interesting, managing to put a freshish spin on the whole ""boy meets girl"" thing that is seen so often in films. I did slap my head a few times when I thought the film had strayed into the realms of cheese that I thought it was going to stay away from, but these conventions are needed for the story to work. One scene in particular where the dude stands up in a meeting at work and makes a heartfelt speech about what he has learnt (and therefore the films message) went slightly too far in my opinion and cheapened an otherwise pretty original film.Zooey Deschanel has really sexy eyes.I think it is attempting to show the reality of love and life, which is that there isn't really a reality beyond what we impose based on our experiences and environment, which these days has been really quite distorted by the fakeness and shallowness of Hollywood love stories. The trouble with trying to do a critique like that is that when you have to write an ending to it you have to follow through with your convictions and let the story come to its natural conclusion, a conclusion, in this case by definition of the thesis, isn't going to sit well with the conventions of the genre. I think they chickened out, but only slightly. I do recommend that you see this film for yourself and see what you think.

Well, he wasn't lying....kind of. As far as the outcome of this movie is concerned, it's more ""The Breakup"" than it is Two Weeks Notice. The 2 main characters don't end up together in the end.....but this IS still a love story. It just happens that it's a story about failed love.Joe has met the girl of his dreams in Summer. She's pretty, funny, quirky....pretty much everything you'd want in a girlfriend. Yet, they break up in one of the opening scenes. The rest of the movie visits specific days in their love affair, in a non-linear fashion. One scene we see their first meeting, the next scene is 200 days later and they are fighting, the next is their first date. I found that it was a little tough to keep track of ""what came first"", but that's a very minor issue. The movie is consistently funny, and at times touching. Eventually the movie takes a turn into the more serious and I found a lot of it to be unexpected (but not unwelcome). I won't go into details, but it rang very true in my experience.The movie is decidedly from Joe's point of view, so while the movie may look like a chick flick on the outside, I think that realistically, it's more a movie for guys.....specifically, for any guy who's ever had their heart broken. Many of us have had a Summer. I know I have. And pretty much everything Joe goes through is instantly relatable. Not knowing what the hell just happened because everything seemed just perfect. It's only when you can step back and really look at your relationship that you realize ""hmmmmm, maybe the cracks were there after all"".I don't wanna say too much more about this one. I really enjoyed it, and I look forward to seeing it again when it comes home. Oh, and I really liked the ending. I thought it was the perfect way to end the movie.Definitely Recommended.P.S.

(500) Days of Summer,382,Ed Uyeshima,16/Aug/09,8,7.834987524442099e-07,film movie not story comedy well films way love make makes movies still great two only see also without many big sense romantic get really hollywood dont moments plot,0.25,4.0,inf,inf,inf," Many critics are already describing this 2009 indie romantic comedy as this generation's ""Annie Hall"", but the comparison is apt only to the point where both movies surprise and delight with their persistently unpredictable approaches to well-worn themes of love gone awry over the course of a relationship. I still don't think that this film, directed by feature-film neophyte Marc Webb and scripted by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Webb, achieves the emotional resonance of the earlier Woody Allen classic, probably because there have been so many attempts in the intervening three decades to copy it, but this fresh-faced film is certainly not without its moments of charm and genuine revelation about the principal characters.The time-jumping story follows the course of the rocky, five-hundred-day relationship between two LA-based twenty-somethings __ Tom, an underachieving greeting-card writer who has not quite given up on his dreams to become an architect, and Summer, a recent Michigan transplant who is not looking for any long-term commitments. She is definitely the object of his growing affection, while she remains steadfastly a Holly Golightly-like fantasy figure. For a stretch, the movie feels somewhat facile and light-hearted in sketching the beginning of their courtship with the halted dialogue after a drunken karaoke night and a walk through IKEA as they pretend to be happy marrieds. The plot gets more interesting as their defining moments become jumbled from Tom's own sense of recollection, including Webb's use of film-school gimmicks like a split-screen treatment of a real-versus-imagined reunion and full-on tributes to Fellini and Bergman movies. The film's funniest bit is also the most unoriginal __ a post-coital musical number set to Hall & Oates' ""You Make My Dreams"" that looks a lot like the Dr. Pepper ""Be a Pepper"" commercial from the 1970s.Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""Brick"") really comes into his own as Tom, providing a thoughtful depth to his portrayal of the likable but pained protagonist. As Summer, Zooey Deschanel has the more difficult role since we don't get a view of her inner feelings the way we see Tom's. However, she uses her big blue eyes and malleable, off-kilter manner to great effect here. More importantly, she makes Tom's emotional free-fall completely understandable. Other roles are filled out more predictably __ Chloe Moretz as Tom's too-wise-for-her-years younger sister Rachel, and Geoffrey Arend and Matthew Gray Gubler as his two semi-slacker buddies. Still, this movie feels a lot fresher than most of the Hollywood product out there thanks to Webb's prodigious approach. He uses the ambiguous ending to Mike Nichols' ""The Graduate"" very well here, and there is a nice appreciation for Los Angeles architecture capped by a last scene in the legendary Bradbury Building.

A refreshing somewhat off-kilter romantic comedy about a hopeless romantic believing in one true love who falls for Summer, the girl who doesn't believe in the concept of love at all and even less in conventional labels. Yet she likes him and they do have a form of relationship. The narrative structure is peculiar going back and forth in non-chronological order during 500 days, of what? I won't tell you. It makes for some fun storytelling showing contrasts before and after certain events. There are some interesting visual finds (such as the split screen between expectations and reality, and the city fading) but overall it's rather conventional in terms of cinematography with ""actors staring straight at the camera"" shots being used a fair bit. The writing was at times quite clever and other times sounded realistic and sincere. I loved the narrator who added both seriousness and whimsy to the proceedings. I didn't care for the product placement of Ikea but I suppose it gives instant recognition as to what type of store it is. The audience I was with really responded to the movie: laughing, sighing and seeming to have a great time. I also enjoyed myself and smiled often. There are some really funny amusing scenes in this flick. The two leads were quite charming, enthusiastic and had a wonderful chemistry. He's been acting since he was a kid but I predict great things for Joseph Gordon Levitt as a leading man. As for Zooey Deschanel as Summer, she has the cool girl next door appeal with something extra that makes her somewhat unattainable yet hard to resist or dislike. She's not bad, she's just honest and doesn't seem to believe in love. The enjoyable secondary characters didn't have big roles but most did have a shining moment with my favorite secondary character being the mature insightful-beyond-her-years younger sister of the main character. The ending seemed a bit forced to me although clever. It could have been better although it does kinda make things come full circle. Actually, watching this again much later on DVD, I think it's close to a perfect ending and it's certainly memorable. I was also forgetting to mention the very nice choice of songs from the likes of Regina Spektor, the Smiths and other cool acts. I see I'm being rather critical but overall I really enjoyed 500 Days of Summer and the more I talked to it with my friend, the more it made me want to see it again.

Let me cut right to the chase -- this is one of my favorite movies so far this summer. It's everything those usually weak romantic comedies are not (see The Ugly Truth review via link below). It's smart, it's unpredictable, it's enjoyable. I had a smile on my face from the opening narrative -- when a voice-over proclaims, ""this is a story of boy meets girl...but it's not a love story."" The film moves in a non-linear fashion from the perspective of greeting card designer Tom(Gordon-Levitt) who falls for his new co-worker, Summer (Deschanel).Over the span of 500 days of their relationship, Tom goes from ecstatic giddiness one moment (even indulging in a classic fantasy song and dance sequence at one point) to crippling depression the next. The question is -- will everything work out and end neatly wrapped-up as most Hollywood endings do? I highly recommend you see for yourself.Gordon-Levitt (Mysterious Skin) proves once again that he has mastered the uneasy transition from child star to adult roles. And Deschanel (so wooden in The Happening) is growing on me -- her quirkiness is definitely better suited for comedies than straight-up drama. But I was most amazed to learn that this is director Marc Webb's first motion picture. Webb, a music video and short film director, does a masterful job in this lyrical portrait of why and how we try so hard to make sense of love.Grade: A-; I review movies @ http://movies-TV-entertainment.blogspot.com/ "," Eight years  starring together  Manic, Zooey Deschanel  Joseph Gordon-Levitt re-team   offbeat romantic comedy/drama   woman  doesn't believe true love exists   young man  falls  .

If you have gone through the things in the movie and know people like Tom and Summer it makes it a lot easier to buy into it. I do not think I know anyone like Tom, but I did not buy into the whole downfall. I totally bought into him falling in love and some of my favorite moments was when he was falling in love with her. When they had finally broken up I felt as if he overreacted, but a lot of people do not agree with me. Maybe that is exactly how people would react to that type of situation, but since I would not act that way and I feel as if he was just taking it really badly and needed to grow up. I love the characters in every other sense though. I thought JGL nailed some of those scenes to perfection and I loved when they were lying on the bed in Ikea and she says that she is not looking for something serious and his cheek twitches and you have a fantastic reaction shot there. Subtle in every way, but extremely telling if you noticed it. I have thought some of the exact thoughts as he did and I am one of those guys that could fall in love like that, but in the end I feel if some of it was too far reaching for me to relate to.I liked the non-linear story telling, but for me it also detracted from the movie a little bit because I was constantly reminded of Tom's reaction to being dumped. So that made the movie fun also took something away from the movie for me.I loved the little sister and how her innocence actually produced some fantastic advice. That actress is someone to watch in the future. I loved how the friends could not help him, but his sister can. I guess it is Weber's way of saying that Tom's views on love are very much like a child and very innocent.I loved the illustration part of the movie and it felt good to watch.I guess I did not really like how the movie's ending was kind of clich Ã and tried to sew things together nicely in the end, but I loved how Tom kept his innocence and his hope for that love. As silly as the last line was I loved it and would not change it no matter how sappy it was.The ending dragged a bit and I think it showed that Weber is a first time director, but none of this stops this from being a good movie and something I thoroughly enjoyed watching.The last thing I have to mention is I loved the dance scene and how spot on it was. The Han Solo reference could not have been better done. It made me so happy to see that.In the end the movie just did not click with me as much as it did with other people because I do not know people that would react that way nor would I react in that way even though I am like Tom in more ways than one.

Interesting, considering our preconditioning for the romantic comedies of happily ever after, or in this case, the indie romantic comedy with ""a way of working out"" that has been done so many times already that ""indie"" is more a style than a way to distinguish the production value of a film. But avoid labeling itself all it wants (as its main characters Tom and Summer try and do), ""Summer"" is a love story. There might be more to it than that, but it's a story about love and how we romanticize it versus how it really is, regardless of its disclaimer. It's a bold script from first-time scribes Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber that pits RomCom convention against the harsh realities of dating. As such, it's bound to appeal to both the chick flick crowd and indie-lovers -- it will get audiences thinking more perceptively about love, while still appealing to the pleasures of escapist movie-theater romance.Like eight of the last ten indie love stores you've seen, ""Summer"" starts with a break-up, only it backtracks to the beginning of the relationship and tells the story from the beginning (while of course jumping back to the time of the break-up). Confused? Conveniently a counter helps us keep track of time in the film, showing us how many days into the 500 we are at all times. Anyway, Tom is a hopeless romantic greeting-card writer played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""3rd Rock from the Sun"" child star and Heath Ledger look-alike) who meets a girl, Summer (big-blue-eyed rising star Zooey Deschanel). He believes he's found destiny -- she doesn't want anything serious.The two hit it off with their playful personalities and while Tom falls hopelessly in love with her, she doesn't seem to budge. We start to hate on Summer a little bit for not prescribing to this fated romance we've built up in our heads because we're all sucker's for that kind of a love story, but that's where ""Summer"" gets smart on us.Directed by Marc Webb, who's done music videos with Green Day, 3 Doors Down and Jesse McCartney, ""Summer"" does take on this whimsical quality that very much appeals to a younger generation. At the same time, he brings us realism when the movie is supposed to relate to us the most (in the bars, at the office) and that artsy quality when the writing calls for something a bit more non-traditional. He handles the contrast well, as does Gordon- Levitt, who is either playing a depressed pessimist or a head-over-heels optimist. Deschanel is also terrific, looking the part of this elusive girl with classic good looks and emphasizing her quirks as well her brutal honesty. If she can break her indie typecast, Deschanel will become one of the finer actresses of her generation.As told by the film's slightly obnoxious and inconsistently used narrator, ""this is not a love story"" ends up serving to prep us for the film's divergence from formula. For those that want happily ever after, it tempers this expectation, pleading with us by basically saying ""please don't get get mad if the ending isn't the magical song and dance number you were hoping for."" But it ends up being pretty clear what ""Summer"" is trying to do. It serves as the writers' own discovery of what exactly love is, how they worked out and reconciled the pain and heartbreak -- love's truths -- with this romanticized idealizing of love. Summer becomes not this cold person who is having her way with Tom because he's the one in love, but someone with simply a different understanding of love, who comes from a different place mentally/emotionally when it comes to relationships.""Summer"" is a great film because it combines all the cheesy energy that we love about romantic comedies with this strong sense of reality. Although the reality too can become a bit much at times, ""Summer"" is a film that has finally found a way to appease the masses while breaking the formula that has kept the boy meets girl story on a ball and chain for decades. It's not a perfect, but what a feat that is. ~MMRVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com/ "," ""(500) Days  Summer"" informs us right away    boy meets girl story, not  love story.

Boy meets girl, girl doesn't want a relationship. Boy pursues anyway. The cast, however, makes most of it work. The two leads do maintain some kind of chemistry, but it's told to us from the very beginning that this is not a love story, so there's no reason to get caught up in their romance. Another facet that the film is missing is that it never shows their relationship in full bloom. We only see the beginning and the end, for the most part. Why does the male lead long for Summer after they break up? That's not really established. He's basically in love with being in love. Summer is more cautious (aka mature) than that. Basically, it relies on melodrama (music set to action) to elicit some kind of emotional response, and a lot of it is repetitive. As far as charming or delightful go, this is a break up movie. It's depressing more than anything. But if you like what the clich Ãs that have filled independent cinema, this movie should satisfy.P.S. Also, beware of massive product placement in this one.

The film was one of the few to emerge from the festival with momentous Oscar buzz, and even a bit of controversy over a specific scene late in the film that was causing people to faint in theatres.The film chronicles the true story of Aron Ralston (James Franco), a recklessly arrogant mountain climber whose arm gets crushed under a boulder during a trip through Utah canyon country. With no one coming to save him, he must decide whether he will die or fight for survival.The logline and description may not sound like much, but 127 Hours delivers one of the most riveting and incredibly emotional experiences I have had in a theatre in some time. I was unsure Boyle and his crew could top their Oscar-winning work in Slumdog Millionaire, but this film improves upon it in every way possible. Because of all the talk about ""the scene"", the majority of people will know how the film ends well before they even consider seeing it. But everything leading up to Aron's life-altering decision is absolutely amazing and the stuff of pure filmmaking magic.From the very beginning up until the very end, you know you are in the hands of some truly special filmmakers, specifically Boyle. Everything in the film seems to have a pulse and a life of its own, whether it is the hyper kinetic editing, the lush and gorgeous cinematography, the often epic score, the thought-provoking writing or just the general style of the film. Where other movies pay very little attention to the little things, Boyle and company seem to have amped up the quality in the majority of those areas, and made a film whose elements very much complement each other. I could not believe the short running time at first, but they pack so much in and the film moves at such an aggressively energetic pace, that you barely have time to slow down and breathe once the film really gets moving.One of the unique things that really stood out for me was the use of flashback throughout the film. Ralston spends a lot of time thinking about what brought him to this life changing moment, and it is rather interesting how Boyle handles these thoughts. They act specifically as our way into Ralston's life and his character dynamic, but they never seem to overtake the bigger picture of his being pinned by the rock. They work rather brilliantly as asides, as mere stylishly and crazily edited set pieces (a naked party in the back of an SUV is a particular standout). They are among the film's few scenes of character interaction, and help the audience adjust deeper and deeper into Ralston's mindset. It aids the film in being an even greater experience of authenticity. His hallucinations are done in very much the same way, but do not work nearly as great as these off-the-wall scenes do.The lengthy cast list may not suggest it, but the film is really just the James Franco show. We only get fleeting and stylishly edited glimpses of him at first, but after the boulder comes down, the film becomes a deeply focused, claustrophobic and devastatingly candid character piece driven almost exclusively by facial movements and reactions. 2010 has been a year of transformations by actors, and Franco's turn as Ralston is no different. The camera gets right in his face and shows us the gritty reality of his predicament, and Franco is eerily authentic in his portrayal. You can see the gradual exhaustion and desperation taking its toll on him; you can see the visible fear on his face as he faces life or death. Not many actors are able to drive a film by mainly interacting with themselves and the static objects around them, but Franco delivers in spades at every turn. Whether he is being devastatingly hilarious or dead serious, he still manages to ensure the realism and intensity of his performance never changes. You will be unable to take your eyes off this riveting portrayal at any time.While it pains me to have to point out the film's small amount of imperfections (even with the attention to detail), it is only because I cannot wrap my head around the film being absolutely flawless. This is an incredible piece of cinema, but there are a few special effects, musical and editing choices made that are simply baffling. I understand the point and logistical ideas around some of them, but some just stand out as odd. Why point out the insects that inhabit Ralston's surroundings, and then make them so CGI'ed that they look visibly fake? Why throw in the out of place tunes to help try and convey his emotions? I know I am pulling at strings, but there were at least a handful of elements that seemed out of place and made the film slightly less than perfect. It just seems these extra steps easily could have been made to make the film even more pristine.127 Hours is not just a film __ it is an experience. It is only in limited release now, but I can only hope that audiences everywhere will get the opportunity to see the movie. It is an amazing movie centred around an absolutely incredible, legendary performance. Watching Franco bare his soul on-screen is practically a cleansing experience. I went in with high hopes, and left with a huge smile on my face. It is authentically emotional, and in a year merely punctuated with a handful of amazing movies amongst a sea of filth, it more than just stands out. It is quite simply, unforgettable.9.5/10.

Danny Boyle, who brought us 28 DAYS LATER and SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE had a lot to live up to with the quality of prior movies, and he did not disappoint. He brought the challenge of creating an interesting movie based on our main character being immobile to life, and captivating it was. Being stuck with our main character the entire duration of the film was anything but tedious, as we follow the thoughts of canyoneer Aron Ralston (James Franco) as he gets trapped under a rock while exploring the beautiful sights of Utah. The camera does a fabulous job taking us everywhere a wandering mind might migrate in a situation such as this.The human connection element was most fascinating, as we wonder what we would do if placed in a similar situation. We are really ""with"" Ralston on his journey, as we see him discover a reason to live and how his life perspective changes, not just how to get free from his predicament. The film manages to stay optimistic and warming, despite the frustration and angst felt by Ralston and viewers. And we certainly thank Boyle for some of the lighter moments that temper the severity of the situation.The film does not shy away from tough choices and certainly keeps it ""real"" during the entire run, especially during the critical climax scene. Despite being stuck in place the movie is fascinating at the pace with which it moves and keeps the audience's attention from start to finish. So while Ralston loves living on the edge, we see Boyle create this movie in a similar fashion, metaphorically speaking, as the intensity and gripping nature of Ralston's circumstances comes alive and sucks us in.In the movie Aron Ralston sets off on a typical weekend excursion being outdoors and with nature. During his journey he befriends a couple of female hikers who are somewhat lost and looking to get back on their way. He shows them the ropes of the canyons and they set off home. Little do they know that their friend will need their help just moments later. Becoming trapped under a rock, Ralston now is faced with the challenge of keeping himself alive while trying to break loose from the rock's firm grasp. As Aron works on a solution, we see him wonder about the party he's been invited to just hours earlier, think about how his has ignored his family, wonder about where he left his Gatorade, which would keep him hydrated longer, do a live interview featuring himself on camera, and drink his own urine.I think the part of the movie that moved me the most actually occurred after the climax, where we see Ralston, broken, desperate, and willing to end his lone-wolf mentality for good. The emotions felt during the last 5 minutes signify human triumph, perseverance, and the power of the human spirit.

It's often used to describe a film, perhaps more often a performance. I've certainly used it; it's a term I like to pull out when a film seems to go beyond the call of duty. When it's more than art, entertainment, or a combination of both. When the story, images, and characters pop off the screen and go with you, and the lasting impression left on you means something more than having killed a couple hours in a big, dark room with a bunch of strangers. Now, after watching 127 Hours, I feel I've never used ""triumphant"" in the correct critical context before.James Franco's performance is simply astounding. He, as an actor, is triumphant because his character is, and because he delves into what it means to be bringing this incredible story to life on the big screen for mass consumption. This is a tough role - Franco is basically putting on a one-man show, and he does so elegantly. We feel Aron Ralston's pain because Franco feels his pain and shows it in every line of his face, verbalizes it with every sigh, and lets it control him even as he battles to take control back and find a way out of his dire situation.It's pure, masterful art. Franco is simply flawless. Trapped by the boulder, much of his performance lies in his facial expressions, and he is able to deftly switch from desperation to comedy to a brutal will to survive, all while being barely able to move. I've rarely been so impressed by an actor's work; Franco is wholly deserving of the Oscar.Danny Boyle's kinetic, energetic direction is a perfect match for Franco's easy-going goofiness, and even when the film becomes grounded in the narrow canyon where Ralston was trapped, Boyle always keeps things interesting. He and co-writer Simon Beaufoy weave flashbacks and hallucinations into Ralston's dilemma to great, heart-breaking effect, and the premonition that drives Ralston to finally dive whole-heartedly into amputating his own arm is breath-taking in its tenderness.Also impressive is Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography. Instead of letting the confined space limit their camera techniques, they tackle every possible angle, often bringing the audience uncomfortably close to the action. Shots through the bottom of Ralston's water bottle mark time and heighten the sense of urgency. The addition of home movie-style footage brings Ralston even closer to the audience; when he expresses his delayed gratitude to his family, you'll likely find yourself thinking about the last time you told your parents how much you love them. It's a great device, and is put to best use in one of the film's funniest scenes, when Ralston interviews himself Gollum-style. The combination of the dark humor, varied cinematography, and Franco's impressive facial dexterity pitch the scene perfectly; it's a lighter moment that is nevertheless grounded in the gravity of the situation.Complementing and combining Chediak and Mantle's beautiful shots is Jon Harris's dynamic editing. The use of split-screen is particularly brilliant, put to use in innovative ways throughout the film: the bookend sequences mark Ralston's departure from and return to society, and the technique in general represents the multiple facets of a seemingly simple tale. Yes, when it comes down to it, 127 Hours is a film about a mountain climber who gets stuck under a boulder and has to cut off his own arm. But it's so much more than that. It's about a man overcoming the physical, emotional, and intellectual strains of an unthinkable situation. It's about responsibility, love, and the will to live. Above all, it's about the triumph of the human spirit, show more clearly and beautifully here than in any other film I can think of.

127 Hours,406,saareman (alan.teder@sympatico.ca),13/Sep/10,10,1.4082328830436988e-09,film movie not will well time can way make just makes director fun new never two only see first made also many character take get audience screen seen right music might,0.635897436,195.0,inf,inf,inf," I started loving this film within the first few seconds. 127 Hours begins immediately with the sound of Fresh Blood's ""Never Hear Surf Music Again"" (""There must be some f*%#ing chemical, chemical in your brain, that makes us different from animals, makes us all the same."" etc...) just as featured in the 1st trailer. That not-ripped-off euphoric feeling (how many times have you seen a trailer with a perfect song/music and then felt betrayed that it wasn't in the film later... yeah, me too) carried on all the way through the rest of the film.The film has an energetic start with a split screen showing office-bound commuters/workers going along their daily drudge while our lead, x-treme biker/hiker/climber Aron Ralston (played to perfection by actor James Franco) packs his gear (unfortunately not finding his Swiss Army knife which might have made a lot of difference to him later on) for a trek into Blue John Canyon country in Utah. While on his way he has a brief fun climbing/diving/swimming interlude with two female hikers (played by Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn). He then heads off on his own and at about 20 minutes into the movie takes a tumble with a small boulder that ends up pinning his right arm against the side wall of the thin crevice of a canyon. And that is where we are with him for the next ""127 hours"" (but only 1 hour of screen time) that it takes him to get loose.I'm not going to spoil that resolution here, although most will likely hear about it anyway before seeing the movie. An obvious clue that he survives is given by the screen credit early in the film that says it is ""based on the book Between A Rock And A Hard Place by Aron Ralston"". The guy must of survived if he wrote a book about it right? Well, you can survive in many ways and not all of them leave you whole (both mentally and physically).Director Danny Boyle brings a lot of the key Oscar-winning players of the Slumdog team back for this new film. Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy, soundtrack composer A.R.Rahman and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle (this time paired with Enrique Chediak) are chief among those. As an added bonus, from the director of the toilet-diving cam in Trainspotting, we now have the ""desperately thirsty character saves his own urine so it can be filmed while drunk through a tube""-cam in this movie.At the Toronto Film Festival's 2nd screening of the film, Boyle was there to take questions from the audience and his enthusiasm and excitement about the film were infectious. Tidbits included his talking about their 6 days of location shooting followed by a sound-stage recreation of the canyon based on 3D scanning imagery. Boyle also praised actor James Franco and emphasized how every time we see him in a new film he is stretching his talents and abilities, unlike many lead actors who are just basically playing themselves in various different situations.Boyle said that for an audience to watch what would otherwise be deemed ""unwatchable"" you either had to be making a schlocky/not-to-be-taken-seriously horror movie OR you had to make the audience completely identify with the character to the extent that they would believe that they themselves would have done the exact same thing to save themselves if they had to. Well, Boyle succeeds in making you believe it.Seen at the Ryerson Theatre, Toronto Sept. 13, 2010. 2nd screening of 3 at TIFF 2010.

That is the naked truth about our existence and the main allegory written in the stimulating visual experience provided by Danny Boyle in his latest film. 127 Hours is a wonderful metaphor for solitude and for the importance of what life means at an individual level. It enhances the indescribable experience of having a family, friends and love, but most of all cherishes the meaning of human contact. Solitude is perceived as being bearable and a lot of times needed but seldom is viewed as being fulfilling. Only when the epiphany pops into our minds, we realize what we have been missing. It is a common and frustrating fact. Nonetheless, Danny Bolyle's achievement allows a new and fresh take on this theme. The director shows the audiences that life happens when they least expect. And truth be told, there is a bright place for those who abandon their egotistical ""independence"" and start sharing the events that life provides.Telling a story about a man who is stuck in the same place for such an extensive period of time is definitely not easy. Danny Boyle described the picture as ""an action movie in which the hero doesn't move"" and he certainly took the challenge. With this in mind, two main conclusions can be withdrawn from Boyle's work: 1) He was able to maintain the action dynamic and the viewers engaged through a series of devices that allow them to be interested not only on the hero's present condition but also in his past and, quite possibly, his future. The mind behind Trainspotting entered the psyche of his new hero and gave it a shape and a texture that transformed the general perception. The empathy towards the character grew and from that moment on the audience grabbed the hook. He was able to dissect James Franco's character thoughts and desires in a moment of extreme physical and psychological agony.2) It was extremely hard to be inventive in such scenario and some techniques proved to be tiresome. In certain moments during the movie, Danny Boyle seemed to be trying to hard when having a simpler approach looked like to be more successful. He stylized the action in a way that doesn't always work even considering that he established his filmmaking style from the very beginning.With regards to the main performer, it is only fair to praise James Franco's enactment. It is a truly astonishing tour-de-force that will probably be mentioned during the Oscar nominations. He's not only charming and witty but his personality fills the screen with such a great talent. It is very gratifying to observe his evolution according to the character's state of mind.127 Hours is a quite remarkable achievement. There's the ability to pick up a true straightforward story about survival and courage and enhance it through a sheer composition of good sense without falling on the old American clich Ã. This story does not try to be epic or monumental. It tries to be honest and true. And we, as viewers, don't feel cheated or slapped across the face, and that is really all we could ask for.

This could have easily been a compelling but plain and ordinary documentary on the Discovery Channel or National Geographic about a man pinned under a boulder who miraculously survives. Boyle, however, transforms it into a powerful statement about the will to live and where that motivation truly comes from.""127 Hours"" does not simply prove the point that humans will do whatever it takes to survive in dire circumstances. In fact, I might argue 9 of 10 people wouldn't do what Aron Ralston (James Franco) does in this film. Anyway, Boyle makes it his mission to use Ralston's incredible true story -- one that told at face value would probably just elicit gasps -- to alter our perspective on living. What's obvious is that none of the impact of ""127 Hours"" is possible without Franco. A film about a man trapped in a crevice for more than five days needs a heck of a lead actor and Franco, despite few dramatic credits to this point, proves beyond capable. Although boredom might set in for some during this film given its plot, the believability of Franco's performance remains constant and irrefutable. He possesses the fun-loving and care-free charisma of Ralston then slowly breaks that shell and shows his human fragility.Yet remarkably, Boyle leaves a substantial thumbprint on the film, much of which he shares with co-writer Simon Beaufoy, also of ""Slumdog."" Because the story is so straightforward, Boyle recognizes imagery and perception provide his only means of creativity. He shows us inside the tube of Ralston's water backpack, water bottle and other close-ups, all of which seem unnecessary, but they establish images which we will come to think about with a different perspective as the film wears on, such as when Aron drinks his own settled urine out of the water pouch. Boyle uses the same process shot, but suddenly we don't see it the way we did earlier and they become more meaningful than tedious.This subtly effective technique can also be found in the beginning and ending shots of the film. It seems completely random that Boyle would open with crowded streets of people as if he's tricked us and really made ""Slumdog 2,"" but the image gains significance after experiencing Ralston's journey.""127 Hours"" will not be kind to people who don't take lightly to seeing blood outside of the ""shoot 'em up"" genre. Many of these people will leave the film thinking all they got was shock value, but of course there's much more to it. Despite the ""how will he survive?"" plot, a substantial amount of time is placed on flashes to memories Aron thinks of regarding his family, fantasies and of course, regrets. Boyle beautifully shows us that although survival seems an inherently selfish thing, much of that motivation and will to live comes from other people, even total strangers. Aron thinks a lot of the girls (Kata Mara and Amber Tamblyn) he hiked with just hours before the accident though otherwise he'd have likely forgotten them.The build-up and catharsis of Aron's story might not be the most powerful and uplifting based-on-true-story you've witnessed, but ""127 Hours"" clearly surpasses expectation in terms of the message it sends and the impact it leaves. With it, Boyle solidifies his place as one of those filmmakers you must always have an eye on and Franco emerges as a relatable everyman with above-everyman-grade talent.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com ","  demonstrated   ability  earn acclaim  everything  zombie films (""28 Days Later"")  foreign coming-of-age love stories (""Slumdog Millionaire""), Danny Boyle   extraordinary gift   filmmaker   ""127 Hours,""  channels    extraordinary story  human willpower.    easily   compelling  plain  ordinary documentary   Discovery Channel  National Geographic   man pinned under  boulder  miraculously survives.

He loses sight of his goals and sets about impressing the girls involving them in irresponsible behavior jumping around the sharp and dangerous rocks of Moab, Utah.Soon after leaving the girls, he's still jumping around like a jerk when the ground gives way; he slides, and his forearm is stuck under a very heavy rock. He makes a courageous and focused effort to free himself, but eventually (as you know) he'll cut off the arm to save his life. (These scenes are no more graphic than necessary.)

Unfortunately, his life was apparently no more interesting than that of a cigar store wooden Indian -- not much there.We're initially given nothing to make us care about Ralston, later we learn nothing much, and by movie's end he's still a blank slate.Danny Boyle uses a few cheap tricks such as turning the volume up seriously loud on the background music when something (supposedly) interesting happens.

127 Hours,410,Alex Di,30/Jan/11,1,3.151526118234751e-07,movie one not funny even time way much just movies never two see without real doesnt get long right dont,0.583333333,156.0,inf,inf,inf," Just like the infamous Confused Matthew I'm feeling confused about this movie. Why does it get so high of a score?I knew right from the start this movie was going to be an awful experience. I knew right from the start it had two ingredients that would kill this movie for me. Firstly it is based upon real event, and an interpretation of real events is always such a delight to witness. And secondly it was about a guy talking to himself for ninety five percent of the movie. To me even one of those two reagents is a no go.But alas I was in a way dragged in to see it, nothing I could do about it. And the reason I hated this movie so much wasn't because of the two constructs established, but a third I wasn't aware of before a movie ended. If it hadn't been for the third thing I wouldn't even waste my time on writing a review.And the third thing is: it tries to convey a wrong message, and does so poorly!There is a fundamental difference between being a loner and being an idiot. And our beloved protagonist played by Jim Franco is exactly both. But the funny thing is that the movie blames all his misfortunes not on him being an idiot, but rather on him being a loner.I am a cynical loner myself.

 excellent films in many different genres. However, his films never 
 enjoyed the box-office reach they deserved. That is, until his 2008 
 surprise blockbuster Slumdog Millionaire broke all expectations. It was 
 a film that would then allow Danny Boyle to create whatever film 
 project he wanted, with presumably whatever budget he needed. 
 
 This is a dream situation for any director, but instead of taking the 
 opportunity to direct a massive budget film, he writes and directs, 127 
 Hours. The film, which tells the incredible true story of Aron Ralston, 
 could be handled in incredibly different ways. Luckily, Boyle's film 
 about a man having to cut off his own arm doesn't leave you feeling 
 depressed, but rather it is energetic and life-affirming. The film 
 doesn't tone down any of the difficult aspects, in fact it throws them 
 right in your face. However, what makes this film so fantastic, is that 
 Boyle's style matches Ralston's view on life and explanation for 
 surviving the awful ordeal. 
 
 The film begins at a furiously kinetic pace, one you would be hard 
 pressed to find in an action film. It is a jolt to the senses and it 
 sets the perfect mood for the film. It is not making light of a 
 terrible situation but rather putting you in the mind set that Aron 
 Ralston was in before the accident occurred. What makes this 
 directorial decision so important is the fact that without 
 understanding the kind of person he was, we couldn't understand how he 
 survived the awful ordeal he was in.
 
 This is what makes Boyle perfect for the material, where another 
 director would most likely go very minimalist, Boyle goes all out in 
 terms of style, without ever losing the emotional connection. Boyle's 
 stylistic choices heighten emotional integrity where as other 
 directors' use of style is often just visual stimulation. 
 
 As important Boyle's direction was to making the film great, if it were 
 not for James Franco's performance as Aron, the film would have failed. 
 Franco gives one of the strongest performances of his career, if not 
 his best. His performance could very easily have become showy and 
 overly dramatic, yet Franco was smart enough to restrain himself until 
 the moment called for dramatics. 
 
 It would be a real shame to forget the unsung heroes of this film, the 
 two directors of photography; Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle. 
 As the film features, for the most part, one man on screen for the 
 duration, Boyle decided to make the visuals into their own characters. 
 To do this, he employed two fantastic directors of photography to make 
 the visuals competing characters. As the film progressed, remembering 
 the incredibly impressive shots became harder and harder, to a point 
 where I lost count. The film features some of the most memorable shots 
 of Boyle's career, many of which leave you wondering how they possibly 
 accomplished them.
 
 Danny Boyle has made a career of films about men who are pushed to 
 their absolute limits, yet the films always leave you feeling better 
 than when you arrived. He does not muddy his films with sentimentality 
 or out of place scenes to make the audience feel better, but his films 
 still leave you feeling an energy for life. It is his talent of finding 
 the strength within people and his natural ability to present it to us 
 that makes his films so powerful. 127 Hours is one of the rare films 
 that leaves an audience in their seats during the credits, and for 
 many, even after the credits are done their scroll.

Five days later he emerged out of the Utah canyons, missing an arm. He had become wedged between a rock and a hard place (literally) and eventually had to cut his own arm off in order to survive. If you were like me you probably thought to yourself, ""Wow, what an awful experience, I bet that sucks. Oh well, back to my life."" The truth is that the self amputation handiwork is not even close to what the man, Aron Ralston, had to go through for the first 124 hours of his ordeal. Having read ""It's Not About the Bike"" by Lance Armstrong, I think it is fair to compare the two stories not only about survivorship but also about the bigger picture in which we call ""life."" You have probably also heard how Armstrong survived testicular cancer to go on to win the Tour De France seven times. Again you might have thought to yourself ""Wow, he had a small bout with cancer and now everything is all right. Oh well, back to my life."" The severe gravity of these situations don't settle in until you hear or see the personal stories of what these individuals endured to earn their lives back. Danny Boyle, is the director who helped bring Ralston's excruciating story to the screen in ""127 Hours."" Boyle, with an eclectic resume including a movie about heroin addiction (""Trainspotting""), a movie about two youngsters finding a bag of money (""Millions""), and a Bollywood movie (""Slumdog Millionaire""), focused on the events that put the viewer in Ralston's position then made that viewer understand that there was only two ways out of the cavern.We start the story with Ralston (played by James Franco) driving out to the Utah canyons while inconveniently forgetting his Swiss Army knife at home (he would need that later). He runs into two young female hikers and introduces them to an underground swimming hole. Not knowing these are the last two people he will have contact with for quite some time.After parting ways with the hikers, Ralston tumbles down a narrow canyon and his right arm becomes wedged between a small boulder and the canyon wall. He has the exact same reaction that I would have, ""AGGHHHH!!!"" I understood his anger because I too would react in the same way. I too would not accept my situation. I too would be cursing at the rock.Before this movie, I did wonder how Boyle was going to keep us engaged for the length of the film. It's a hard task considering Ralston was in one place for five days. Boyle, along with Franco's brilliant acting, was able to keep us flowing from day to day. Sure there are the flash back scenes and a few Scooby-Doo induced hallucinations. But, the one thing that kept my attention was what Ralston actually did while trapped in the crevice. He had a video camera and he videotaped himself giving an ultimate gratitude list to his parents and friends. Even in his dying hours, he wanted his parents to know how he felt about them. He even went as far as producing a humorous morning talk show with himself. It was real, and it worked. That video is now in a safety deposit box where only a few sets of eyes have seen it.Should you see this movie? Yes, but don't see it because a guy cuts off his arm to survive. See it because you want a story about why a guy cuts off his own arm to survive. See it because you need to know the answer to what you would do if you were in Ralston's predicament.

Personally, I think he did an outstanding thing taking on a subject which is hard to put on screen for one hour and half and keep you interested in the character and keep things entertaining: the true story of Aron Ralston, a mountain climber who had to resort to one of the most desperate measures in order to fade death.A profound survival story that doesn't get too melodramatic nor boring or predictable. It challenges the viewer by putting him through the same experience as Aron's thanks to the amazing study of his character and his survival process. 127 Hours entertains by mixing up humor with drama and tense situations. A great journey through Aron's personal experience that goes from his first moments of clarity and then sanity, disappointment and hope, through his hallucinations and premonitions, through his both states of denial and acceptance of the upcoming result and ultimately, through his impressive ambition and desire to live and not accept death as a denouement. James Franco is responsible for caring this movie and make it entertaining thanks to his moving performance. He manages so well to balance his emotional state and ""play"" with his own sanity. His presence on the screen kept the audience in the back of their seats. Speaking of being in the back of the seat, I heard a lot of talk about the ""cutting arm"" sequence which made people fainted or whatever. I expected it to be some gore stuff but it turned out to be more than just OK. It was nothing that harsh to watch... I don't know. Maybe for some really sensitive guys the scene might be a problem but for me it was really nothing that outrageous.Combining the nonconformism in editing with great photography, beautiful landscapes and amazing cinematography 127 Hours stands-out as a striking visually piece of filmmaking. The scenes were cut and put together in an intelligent manor and that majorly helped the movie's pacing. The soundtrack is also one of the best I've heard in a long time. A.R. Rahman is responsible for this beautiful mixture of tribal techno music and uplifting pure melody. The most impressive piece of music I consider it to be within the last couple of minutes right before his ""salvation"" and Dido's vocal performance in the film was destined to make the public to engage emotionally in the movie.127 Hours is another big step in Danny Boyle's career.

I didn't really know what to expect, as all I knew was it was based on a true story about a guy getting stuck in a canyon due to a boulder. I decided to give it a shot and well, I was amazed by this movie. Danny Boyle continues to give us impressive cinematography and incredible performances in his movie, thanks to James Franco, who plays as Aron Ralston, the mountain climber who gets stuck under the boulder if you didn't already know.I'm not going to go into any big spoilers, but it was amazing to see how the movie builds up to the main plot. After getting stuck under a boulder for 5 days, you're probably thinking ""How is this movie going to stay entertaining?"". Well, we witness some attempts of Aron trying to get out of the boulder, as well as using the equipment he brought with him with his backpack to try and survive. He also tries to keep himself awake so that he can live long enough to not die. When all normal attempts to escape fail, as a last resort, he does something very terrifying to get out. When this scene happened, I had to turn away in parts due to how extreme it was!With good uses of hallucinations and flashbacks to keep the story flowing, Danny Boyle has managed to make this movie as realistic as possible. Great music, great filming, and stunning performance. 127 Hours is a fantastic movie about a real-life incident that may be too disturbing to watch for some people, but I'd consider it a must see on all grounds.

SHALLOW GRAVE was made on a total shoestring and perhaps it was this that caused it to be hype . TRAINSPOTTING was considered an unflimable novel but Boyle had a good try though he was helped by Robert Carlyle's show stopping performance as Begbie . 28 DAYS LATER had a rather derivative and illogical screenplay by Alex Garland but Boyle rose above it to make what is considered a genre masterpiece . SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is one of the most unlikely success stories in modern cinema , a story revolving around karma , set in India with an unknown cast that the whole world fell in love with . He has had a few misses however . A LIFE LESS ORDINARY was way below ordinary , THE BEACH showed Boyle isn't suited to Hollywood style film making while SUNSHINE proved he's not suited to space opera either . Despite all this you're always expecting Boyle to come up with a masterwork that will get the whole world falling back in awe . He closest to this with SM but I always think his masterwork is still to come 127 DAYS is based on the true life incident of Aron Halston , a young man who while hiking through the Utah desert fell down a crevice and had his arm trapped by a boulder and who had to take the most extreme measures to save his life . On the surface this is one of these movies award ceremonies love - courage in the face of adversity , but not something that will set the box office alight . In many ways it's something ready made for Boyle . It's not something that can be termed blockbuster but perhaps the director could weave film making magic out of it . Does he succeed ? First of all the trailer is slightly misleading . It seems similar to THE BEACH where some American dude teams up with a couple of hot chicks and does some seriously partying . Thankfully the film deviates away the marketing and concentrates on Ralston's trauma of being trapped . You're left thinking this is for the best since Ralston come across a little bit too sure of himself , a little bit too smart and a little too popular with hot chicks to get the audience entirely on his side so Boyle and screenwriter Simon Beauefoy deservesome credit in to making him something of an everyman who has dreams , ambitions and family This approach works well but the problem with the movie is that the whole premise doesn't comfortably lend itself to commercial film making . It's not an entirely involving film because the audience know the out come of the story and because the protagonist is on his own there's little dialogue and the story telling is done via obvious flashbacks to Ralston's life . The Discovery Channel does countless documentaries on these type of stories but they're rare in cinema and there might be a very obvious reason for this . There's two ways at looking at this 1 ) Boyle deserves congratulations for making an uncinematic film 2 ) The film fails because it is uncinematic The first view is totally valid but unfortunately so is the second point to a large extent As you might expect from Boyle it's impressive on a technical level with outstanding cinematography , editing and sound , though some people may quickly get fed up with the split screen technique . James Franco is impressive as Ralston and will certainly get an Oscar nomination but 127 HOURS will be one of the bridesmaids at the award season where THE KINGS SPEECH , BLACK SWAN and THE SOCIAL NETWORK will dominate while Boyle fans look forward to his next project "," Danny Boyle can    frustrating film maker .

Both films have a very basic premise that requires some imaginative screenplay to sustain them. Climber falls down ravine but survives after resorting to desperate measures; Man becomes become King unexpectedly and has to overcome speech defect. The results of both dramas are already known before the films were made. So Danny Boyle decides to rework Trainspotting to give his story some legs - man cycling/running across landscape to pumping music,liquid/ drugs travelling down tubes, flashback/hallucinatory images, gross out gore etc etc. We have seen it all before including Shallow Grave . Has DB a lavatorial fetish ? Man dives down excrement filled lavatories in both Trainspotting and Slumdog now he drinks urine and dives into fetid puddle in 127. Throughout, the struggle is trivialised with gimmickry, and the hero evokes no sympathy; now in comparison I even empathise with Joe Simpson in Into the Void ! Yet Kings Speech relies on splendid dialogue, appropriate soundtrack and quality acting with the mild outrage of the f word. The lasting message of 127 is a Health and Safety moral - always tell someone where you are going and make sure you take your Swiss Army Knife. No more than that . An Oscar , I hope not. However none of the above should detract from Aron's bravery, his story deserved more sympathetic treatment.

The problem with the massive hype about Danny Boyle's latest creation is that it has a very simple story line. Unless you have been sat on the moon you will realize that it is the story of a man who falls down a hole for 127 hours and cuts his arm off. I was aware of this before i watched the film as most people would be. I honestly thought there would be an occasional surprise or at the very least massive suspense created as the victim gets closer to death. For me there was no real suspense, it was just a self indulgent portrayal of a ""loner"" who now realizes hes stuck down a hole with no one to rescue him, if only he wasn't a loner and had told friends where he was going - yawn.At first I was confused with the reception of this film, and the masses of praise it has gathered. But it is really quite simple. Danny Boyle makes good films, and because of his every growing cult status he can do very little wrong. His supporters are somewhat blinded by his aura that they fail to see a pretty bad film when its put in front of them, and read far too far into certain characters and sequences. 127 hours certainly isn't his best work and i'm afraid i found James Franco average at best. He did not portray the pain that the climber would have been in well enough.

I was curious at how director Danny Boyle was able to expound on this limited premise and get awards buzz, so I watched despite my initial lack of interest. The trapping incident occurs only 15 minutes into the film. From there and the next hour, we get to see Aron talking to himself and to his camera, philosophizing, hallucinating about past and future, as he struggles to survive and extricate himself from this trap. All this, up to the harrowing last 20 minutes when he does escape, all graphically and painfully captured on screen.The spectacular achievement in this film is the beautiful cinematography. The camera work, the composition, lighting and the angles were fantastic. The scenery of the vast canyons, the rolling clouds, the flash flood, the creeping sunbeam, even the water bottle, -- all awesome photography. James Franco has certainly progressed from his Harry Osborne days. He carries this movie all by himself, as there are practically no other supporting characters. This is his one-man show. That scene capturing the moment when Aron first realizes that he is trapped was so naturally done -- a great acting moment for Franco.As I said, initially I did not like to watch this. In all the press releases, we know he will cut off his arm in order to save himself, so there was even no surprise on how the movie will end. You can imagining how singular this incident is, in such an enclosed space, with a particularly gruesome climax. This movie is clearly not for everybody. It shows a man's struggle to survive at all costs. You know the message is positive, but are you willing to watch it? Now, that is another question.

Tackling a story which centres on a largely motionless man deep in a ravine is a big challenge, and is not one which he successfully overcomes. Lead actor James Franco as Aron Ralston does well enough but there is not an awful lot to go on.Based on a true story the film opens up with shots of him as an adrenaline junkie, mountain biking in the Utah desert and canyoneering, long distance running across it. Curiously, in real life he was an able graduate in Mechanical Engineering and French, although that intelligence is never revealed to counter some fairly reckless behaviour.The scenery is fantastic, and the opening act when he chances upon two girls and leads them part of the way is Boyle at his best, playful, pacey and eventful, if a little unlikely. But inevitably once Ralston is trapped, the dramatic options are a bit limited. To his credit, Boyle eschews ""faction"" scenes of encounters with cougars, snakes, near misses by passing helicopters and half heard voices of walkers __ but in fact that does not leave much. We have a storm scene whose dramatic and cinematic potential is underplayed, and then the inevitable self-mutilation.Flash backs pre-dominate and hallucinations unfold, but we never really know enough about Ralston to really care. Then when he does escape from the boulder, a demanding 20m descent is dealt with in a perfunctory manner, he stumbles across some walkers, a helicopter arrives __ and that is it. No denouement, no context. It all feels a little unsatisfactory, a bit like the Billboard Poster which is an invention and depicts no physical part of the film.The music is also poor. Discordant and jarring, it's use as a high octane accompaniment to the biking works, but otherwise it does not work well to try to crank up some artificial excitement. The self-amputation is gruesome and graphically depicted in all of Boyle's gory glory, but that isn't enough in a running time which at 94 minutes feels simultaneously long, and incomplete.

He became trapped at the bottom of a canyon when a boulder dislodged and pinned his right arm to a wall. Over the course of five days with little water, less food, and no hope of being found, Aron made a video diary documenting his ordeal while trying to sustain by any means necessary (including drinking his own urine). Eventually, in a moment of desperation, Aron was forced to amputate his arm with a dull knife in order to escape. Ralston is obviously a brave human being, who was faced with a dilemma in which many people would've chosen death. His act is a triumph of human determination and willpower and his story is brought to life by Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle. 127 Hours is widely considered one of the best films of 2010 and recently received six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. While complaints have been aimed at Aron's character (some people see his decision to not tell anyone where he was going ""stupid), the use of dream sequences/surreal imagery, and Boyle's hyperkinetic style; I found no issue with these aspects of the film. In fact, I've been so impressed by this film the two times I've seen it I can hardly find a negative thing to say about it.Boyle and his co-writer Simon Beaufoy (the Oscar-winning scribe behind Boyle's previous film Slumdog Millionaire) stay faithful to Aron's ordeal and over the course of a riveting 90 minutes, Boyle shows us how powerful the will to survive can be. The success of the film hinges on the dynamite portrayal of Aron by James Franco. The film spends the first 15 minutes establishing Aron's thrill-seeking personality; his drive to Blue John Canyon in Utah, his encounter with two girls (Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara), and eventually the moment where he found himself in an unimaginable situation. From here, it's a one-man show for Franco. Aron has a watch, a video camera, a CD player, headphones, a flashlight, a rope and pulley, but almost no food and little water. Franco leads us through Aron's initial attempts to escape, his quiet acceptance of his fate, and his refusal to simply wait for death. Knowing the ending doesn't make the film any less suspenseful and the proceedings are nothing short of riveting.Boyle tells this story in just 90 minutes, a perfect running-time that neither drags it out nor rushes it. In the hands of another director this could have been a snooze-fest, but Boyle has crafted a film that creates tension by perfectly capturing the claustrophobia of Aron's ordeal. While dream sequences/hallucinations are used, they don't clutter the story needlessly. They are necessary to establish Aron's personality and further the themes that Boyle and Beaufoy are trying to convey with their interpretation of Aron's story. It's not these images or his visual pizazz that Boyle uses to carry the story, but his willingness to stay with Aron and allow James Franco to lead the audience through the story with his show-stopping performance.The success of the film rests on Franco's shoulder and I couldn't spot the slightest misstep in his performance. Franco has to be interesting enough to hold your attention for over an hour, as well as making his character's journey believable. Through body language and tone of voice, Franco makes you believe you're watching an optimistic man slowly relinquish all hope before making one final decision in an attempt to save his own life. This is not a typical Oscar-bait performance, but a nuanced performance built on much subtlety. Spending the bulk of the film in a small space without the use of his right arm, Franco brings the audience right into that canyon with him. When the climactic scene arrives, you believe that Aron has reached this point of desperation. Had Franco made the smallest mistake in his performance, it could've brought the whole film down. I believe James Franco would win the Academy Award if not for Colin Firth as he delivers one of the most riveting and truly impressive screen performances of 2010.One can't discuss this film without mentioning the climax, where Aron must finally take his fate into his own hands and amputate his arm. The scene is both realistic and horrifying, even more when one takes into account that this actually occurred. Rarely does a scene make me wince and recoil the way this scene did. It's brilliantly shot, acted, edited, and executed; graphic, but Boyle only shows as much as necessary relying on haunting sound effects and Franco to convey what's happening. It's a powerful, unforgettable scene.127 Hours is an unforgettable experience that works on so many different levels. It's entertaining, exciting, intense, brilliant, and ultimately moving; a triumphant piece of filmmaking and is undoubtedly one of the best films of 2010. Having seen it several now, it's still as suspenseful and powerful as it was the first time I watched it. While subsequent viewings and time may show some imperfections, it will remain the most intense movie-going experience I had in 2010.

I thought maybe I missed something, seeing as it scores so highly here. Truth is, it just irritates me how somebody so stupid and reckless can be portrayed as some sort of hero. Boyle's freaky insights to Ralston's decaying mind only make matters worse. Had it been an out-and-out adventure film it might have worked better.I'm sure Ralston is not alone in being reckless - most adrenaline junkies are to some extent, which is why so many of them get killed or injured. However, anybody venturing alone into the wilderness needs a bit of common sense, which Ralston clearly lacks. He takes one small bottle of water and little else of use on a trip into a hot, dry, remote area, a journey which only he knows about. That is not reckless, it is just plain stupid.Within minutes of setting off on his bike he has an accident which could have left him seriously injured. Can't ride a bike, don't go careering across rough terrain. Then there is the drop into the pool, which I believe is not actually based on fact, but again illustrates how stupid he and the others were - one or more of them could easily have died.Somehow surviving all this, he then clambers down a shear rock face over loose boulders and debris, so it is not surprising it turns out bad. Frankly from then on it goes from bad to worse, a long drawn-out affair detailing the rather dull and senseless thoughts of a guy who clearly is a sandwich short of a picnic. I'd have been happy for him to get his head trapped by the boulder and have the film end there. Talk about drawing it out ... yawn.So really I fail to see what the point of this movie is. In parts it is nicely filmed and that saves it from scoring 1. There is no tension, no excitement, and surprisingly no real signs of a guy struggling to cling on to life, which I imagine is what one would be doing were one stupid enough to be trapped like this.Anybody reading anything more into this must be sadly lacking in real life experience.

I said to myself that it is a big courage. There is a young man and while he was walking around, he dropped in a place where is 50 meters under of the ground and whose arm pressed between two rocks and he stayed in that situation along 127 hours. Then he had to cut his arm to survive and finally, he was saved by a family. This should be really interesting experience and event and everybody can not do it even for their life.

Yet we want to see it for ourselves out of curiosity if the story is somewhat interesting after hearing the headlines. Isn't that true of every true story that is portrayed on film? People have commented that Aron Ralston is a loner and an idiot and give the movie 2 stars or less. How is that a bad comment about the story in the film? The character himself, and therefore the real person, calls himself these very things! As a loner, he felt invincible, yet as a self declared ""idiot"" he has the intelligence to admit how stupid of a thing he had done. Yes, we can all sit on our little chairs and watch the movie and call him an idiot for not telling anyone where he's going or what he's doing... like we've NEVER done something idiotic before. Sure, perhaps our very own moment of lack of good judgment has not put us in a situation that we may have sealed our own doom...for Ralston he had to come to terms with himself that, indeed he may have just killed himself unintentionally.People also commented that he survives by sheer luck. To them I say, can YOU survive for 6 days doing the same things Ralston did? Forget the idea that you would never be so stupid. The point is, if it were to happen to you, what would YOU have done? Would you even have stopped for a moment to leave a video for your loved ones-loner that you are?People still commented that Ralston felt no pain. We could dismiss the initial accident as being in shock. Later on he shows a great deal of pain...and ingenuity. When I myself had an oops moment with a stupid chainsaw cutting a hole in my knee, I didn't feel one ounce of pain. I just kept saying to myself, how could I be so stupid to have not been more careful. If you only hated this movie because it is about one person for most of the film stuck in a canyon, hallucinating about life, screaming out for help ONCE and hating yourself for doing so because you know no one is out there to hear you and you know yelling is futile (by the way people commented that they would be yelling out - for what? save your energy and look for other viable solutions idiot!), contemplating taking your own life because of your incredible mistake you've made, making a final decision - one that would leave you ""crippled"" - and I mean no offense to amputees, still knowing that even without your right arm you still have to carry your bloodied self, weak from dehydration and having lost over 40 pounds in 6 days (I kid you not), to the HOPE of safety...if you hated this movie for reasons such as these...then you've never had a true ""oops"" moment.

For one, the story is already known and is a very, very real one. This gives those intending to watch it the knowledge that for the best part of an hour and a half it is going to be a bloke stuck with a big rock on his arm. For another it is a single set, single actor set up for the vast majority and in the wrong hands could be a total nightmare. These are inhibitions that the film is going to have to overcome even before it has been viewed.It was with this in mind that I made the decision to watch 127 Hours after having it for a good couple of months. Upon initial viewing I found little of interest in the film and my fears seemed to have been well placed. It was as I have said above - bloke stuck with a big rock on his arm. But I have found that it is one of those rare breed of films that plays on your mind and grows in your affections over time.So what is good about it. The performance that Boyle has managed to get from James Franco is testament to his skill as a director and Franco's as an actor.Franco has impressed me with his performances of late. Milk, Howl (dreadful film, great performance) and Pineapple Express are all splendid and he was very much the right person for the job here. The character he plays is, to me at least, pretty unlikeable. He was selfish, arrogant and careless. Yet through sharing in his unthinkable experience a sense of empathy is developed; the regrets of his life are played out leading to a degree of realisation and repentance. Whether this will change his attitude in the future is another matter entirely but there is hope for him that he will learn from his mistakes and become a better person. At its heart, therefore, its a tale of redemption and are we not all seeking this?! The nuances of the personality are all conveyed by an actor in his prime tasked with an extremely difficult proposition - one set, limited mobility, no other actors around. Franco deserves plaudits for this performance and this aspect alone is worth the majority of my grading.As always, Danny Boyle's direction was spot on. The difficulties of such a film were met head on and the story develops at a solid pace. The photography is impressive, the locations kind of do the hard work but it looks lovely on film. The soon to be famous last scene in the crevice is very realistic and not something for the weak stomached! It is an impressive translation of the story.So why only 7 out of 10? Well to be honest Id probably give it 7.5 but IMDb is a silly so I cant. It wasn't quite perfect. As I said, it was only after viewing that the story really started to hit me. I may watch it again to see if this delayed development translates into increased enjoyment but this is unlikely. It is not the type of film that has repeated viewing qualities. It will never be considered a classic but what it is is a solid film, impressively acted and skillfully directed. When history looks back on Boyle's portfolio of work I would say this would rank well behind Trainspotting, Shallow Grave, 28 Days Later and Slumdog all of which are 8-10 star films. For this reason I have judged it as I have!

It's like a person with little to say that never stops talking for fear of a lull in the conversation. The music is abrasive and usually feels like an intrusion. There seems to be little effort by the filmmakers to create a mood that conveys what the experience must have been like. There is no passage of time __ only images of a watch. Whenever something genuine seems ready to emerge it's preempted by some montage of remote events, as if the viewer constantly needs to be reminded that life goes on somewhere else.Visually, you would think that it would be hard for a film like this to miss. There are some great shots, but the effect is never sustained. It's always undermined by some subsequent material, as if the filmmakers have an unconscious need to negate anything beautiful in their own work.John Franco gives a decent performance, but many of the character's actions don't seem plausible in the given situations, due to the writing. The film's biggest flaw is that it's simply not believable.If you haven't already read the book, you'll want to after seeing 127 Hours. The film simply doesn't ring true.

I went to the cinema with medium expectations of this film. I am a fan of Danny Boyle movies, from Shallow Grave through to 21 Days Later. I liked (not loved) Slumdog Millionaire, but wasn't on the bandwagon of hype that surrounded the movie. I am also a James Franco fan, and loved Pineapple Express and was surprised how well he acted in that movie. I also remember him playing James Dean in a TV movie, which also impressed me too. However, it did not prepare me for what I was about to see with this film.Right from the get go you are introduced to the film with the feel of a pulse, from the music that is played during the credits (May I add the use of music throughout this movie was absolutely perfect, and really added so much emotion and texture to the scenes), right through to the use of camera, and the split screen where you see crowds of people going about their daily lives. It then focuses on Franco's character, Aron Ralston. We see quick, cleverly cut and filmed sequences of him preparing for a hike. From intricate, yet simple shots from inside his fridge, to the top of his shelf, with the focus on his hands grabbing these items. I loved these quick shots, and from the start set the kinetic film style and pace. I am not going to spoil anything for you here, but the next 20 minutes of the film is a build up, which is very cleverly done. Anyone that is familiar with the story will appreciate how well the tension is built upon.After the accident occurs, we are left with Aron as he first physically struggles to get himself out of the situation. You really feel that you are there with him. The locations used are beautiful, yet eerie at the same time. After he is physically worn out from trying to escape, you begin to see the psychological breakdown. This is where things get interesting, and really where Franco shines. As we are with him in this situation, you see how his character goes from thinking he will get himself out of this, to a complete breakdown. As he is trapped there for so long, he finds himself dehydrating, and losing the will to live. However, the things that keeps him going, and keeps the audience completely involved and on tender hooks, is the very cleverly crafted flashbacks of what keeps him going. From is family, one of his past girlfriend's right through to some very well executed hallucinations. Often I found myself laughing at the certain things that Franco's character was thinking and dreaming up in his mind, and after the laughter, Boyle would build the tension straight up again and tug on the heart strings with only a few words and expressions from Franco's face. By the end of the movie, you will be there with the character, you will him to go on. I felt that this movie touched on so many things such as spirituality, love, hope and survival and all these common emotions we all share as human beings. At the very end of the movie, the music yet again is used perfectly, and gave me a joyous, almost overpowering feeling of a mixed range of emotions. I still had the adrenaline pumping from 'that' scene I'm sure many of you reading this are aware of (which was also brilliantly done, from the sound effects of shredding nerves, right through the Franco's acting and the use of the camera angles and sfx). As the end drew to a close, I was struggling to hold back the tears as hard as I could, (my girlfriend had been crying intermittently throughout the film, and I couldn't blame her).127 hours It was a joyous, uplifting, spiritual movie experience. It had all the elements of what filmmaking is about. It was a thriller, a drama, a romance, a horror, even comedy at some points all rolled into one. A poignant, timeless message of what is it to be alive, of how blessed we all truly are, and of how reliant we are upon each other.

He became trapped for over five days, taking drastic measures to survive, before finally resorting to amputating his arm off, and eventually making it out alive. At this point, it's a clich Ã to say, but this is nothing short of a remarkable, and incredible true story.Some would accuse the film of being style over substance, I'd disagree, but I can see the point of their argument, but just hear me out. Danny Boyle is a remarkable director whose films usually include frenetic film editing, inventive camera techniques, and thumping music. Those traits work well in other films of his (like Slumdog Millionaire and 28 Days Later), but while they are clever, they tend to remove focus from the main plot line of THIS film. Unfortunate to say, but the editing and camera-work had a tendency of irritating me.Still, that's no reason AT ALL for me to call 127 Hours a BAD movie, especially not for the film's true driving force, James Franco. He carries the whole film on his back, and 99% of which is entirely on his own. His performance is intense and emotional, and never feels false, never feels preachy, and never lets us take our attention off the screen. One of the year's very, VERY best.And even if the aesthetics tended to get in the way, they can't bog down the passion behind forming the screenplay. Not only is it a successful story of survival, but it also ties in a theme of embracing, rather than shunning society. The sound mix is also sleek, and the pacing tends to hop between slow and fast, and I mean that in the best possible way, as it appropriately shows how the daily struggles of Aron's life either glides by, or drags along. It also features a beautiful end credits song by Dido and A.R. Rahman.If you can look past whatever flaws there are, you'll find A LOT to admire.I give 127 Hours *** out of **** ","  recently saw 127 Hours,  rock (no pun intended) solid movie   true story  Aron Ralston.In  film, James Franco plays Ralston,  thrill seeker whose arm became pinned   boulder   canyon wall    rock climbing  Utah.  became trapped   five days, taking drastic measures  survive,  finally resorting  amputating  arm ,  eventually making   alive.   point,   clich    say,    nothing short   remarkable,  incredible true story.Some  accuse  film   style  substance,  disagree,   can see  point   argument,  just hear  .

What saves Ralston, besides near-mythical courage, is his engineering expertise. He attempts to make pulleys to dislodge the boulder. When these fail he is forced to break bones to slice off his decayed arm, using inappropriate cutting tools to do so. Hard to make this compulsive viewing, as most of the static action takes place in a canyon. But then Boyle is the man who immortalised Irvine Welsh's 'Trainspotting', another book thought to be unfilmable. We've seen breathtaking scenery before, but not like this. Luscious photography means you don't physically have to be in this region to appreciate its grandeur. To hold our attention, Boyle throws everything at us: split screen, catchy pop songs, state-of-the art special effects. I have only a few reservations, but they are significant. I didn't like the scenes of phantasmagoria. I felt they came too often and were off-putting. I also disliked James Franco's portrayal. Praise has been given for him being able to convincingly capture Ralston's self-deprecation and charm, but there's a reason he wasn't Boyle's first choice (British actor Cillian Murphy was): he's as flat as parts of Utah. Sometimes, when a film does phenomenally well, like Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionaire', the success somehow attaches to the director's next film, regardless of the critical reception, and our objectivity gets distorted. It's as though we see their next film with predetermined praise. I think that's what audiences the world over are doing with this film.By his own admission Boyle prefers to make 'vivacious' rather than 'serious' films. '127 Hours' does not contradict.

After an accident with a loose rock, Ralston stumbles into a crevice and ultimately lands with his right arm wedged tightly between the rock and the canyon wall. As the days pass by, Ralston runs low on water, uses up his food, and his efforts at chipping away at the rock with a dull knife seem to be in vain. The only thing that keeps him going are promises he made to his family and the hope that he would one day see his loved ones again.As you can imagine, this movie is as much director Danny Boyle's as it is James Franco's. When nearly all of the film's 94 minutes consist of Franco's psychological turmoil, his acting has to carry the movie, and as expected, Franco pulls it off very nicely. Expect some terrific and believable acting as Ralston struggles not only to free himself from the rocky prison, but also to come to terms with personal mistakes he made earlier in his life. However, 127 Hours may unwittingly fall into the category of 'psychological thriller', and with such a genre comes some strong expectations: intense scriptwriting and extraordinary acting. While the film may not necessarily be a ""thriller"" because it purposely recounts the real-life story of Aron Ralston, it still falls victim to its requirements; and this is where we see a disappointment in the movie. Nothing is missing from the acting side, but the script is regular, rather boring, and predictable. We know Ralston is still alive, we know he suffered, we know some parts were gritty- but no flourish is added to the original story to make it interesting. Everything is straightforward- no twists. 127 Hours wishes itself to be more engaging than it actually is. Still, it stays close to the facts of the book, which leads me to the conclusion that Ralston's tale makes a better story than it does a movie (and that psychological thrillers may not be Boyle's strong suit).James Franco puts out a terrific role in this movie, but aside from his performance you can't expect anything too out-of-the-ordinary or impressive. 6/10 "," 127 Hours,   title suggests, recounts  127 hours  hiker  rock climber Aron Ralston spends stranded   slot canyon, based  recounts   true story  Ralston's best-selling memoir ""  Rock   Hard Place"".   accident   loose rock, Ralston stumbles   crevice  ultimately lands   right arm wedged tightly   rock   canyon wall.   days pass , Ralston runs low  water, uses   food,   efforts  chipping away   rock   dull knife seem    vain.  only thing  keeps  going  promises  made   family   hope    one day see  loved ones again.As  can imagine,  movie   much director Danny Boyle's    James Franco's.  nearly    film's 94 minutes consist  Franco's psychological turmoil,  acting   carry  movie,   expected, Franco pulls    nicely.

127 Hours,452,Max_cinefilo89,07/Feb/11,5,8.602306897244052e-12,film movie one not story good comedy well even films time best way life make just makes movies director still drama fun never two first made also performance though cast without people big real doesnt kind man compelling get audience full screen isnt right dont plot,0.513513514,37.0,inf,inf,inf," From the get-go, people were skeptical about this film adaptation of Aron Ralston's autobiography Between a Rock and a Hard Place, and for good reason: it's hard to make a compelling drama about a man who spent five days of his life stuck in a canyon. Or, as Danny Boyle puts it: ""The audience has to care for the entire 127 hours, not just the last 40 minutes"" (the contents of which it's best not to disclose in case someone isn't aware of how the story ends). Now, it is remarkable, even commendable, that Boyle used his newfound respectability (read: post-Oscar rise in fame) to get this seemingly impossible project off the ground, but throughout the film there's an awkward truth that emerges: he wasn't the right director for this project.A shame, since the story could lend itself to a good movie, provided certain adjustments were made. As Ralston recounts in his book, he should have told someone where he was going on that fateful day in 2003, when his latest mountain trip turned into a nightmare: stuck between a huge boulder and the mountain wall and unable to move, he quickly ran out of supplies and optimism, giving in to hallucinations and video-messages to his loved ones. Then, on the fifth day, he came up with a brave, shocking solution.The challenge, according to Boyle, was making 127 Hours a film that worked as a full dramatic unit, not just a money shot with an irrelevant build-up. His passion for the project was so big that, for the first time in his career, he has also worked on the script (alongside Slumdog Millionaire partner Simon Beaufoy). And for the first fifteen minutes or so, it looks like he's nailed the tone, capturing Aron's euphoria and naivety as he prepares for the hike, arrives at the canyon and interacts with two attractive girls (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) before his unfortunate experience. It's an approach that has worked before - the fun before the tragedy - and it sets up the plot nicely.Unfortunately, once Ralston is stuck (and Boyle with him, so to speak), the director has to figure out how to make the film gripping without leaving the canyon. His solution? He doesn't, allowing for several hallucination and dream sequences that allow him to expand the cast (Kate Burton and Treat Williams as the parents, Lizzy Caplan as the younger sister) and, more importantly, show off his visual trademarks once again. And there lies the real problem with 127 Hours: given the harrowing and very real subject matter, a certain restraint would be expected. Instead, the film is closer in tone to Trainspotting and Slumdog Millionaire, meaning the true story displayed on screen looks too fake and movie-like to fully convince. Okay, so the scenes in question are justified in terms of narrative (Ralston himself has admitted he was hallucinating), but playing them on a loop, like Boyle does (seriously, there's a dream sequence every five minutes), makes for a very repetitive and dull viewing.This also impacts on the central performance, arguably the film's main talking point. Though his talent has never been in question, be it as James Dean, Spider-Man's best friend or a comedy drug dealer, James Franco is justly regarded as one of the finest actors of his generation. However, he's never had to carry an entire movie (well, most of it) like he does here, and it's truly sad that Boyle struggles to keep his camera still, because the pain and despair reflected on Franco's face is the kind of a stuff that, if the overall movie were stronger, would definitely be worthy of an Oscar. Even if the growth (or rather lack thereof) of his facial hair over those five days is absolutely unrealistic.On paper, the combination of material, star and filmmaker was a good match. At the end of it all, though, the result is uneven and unconvincing, and it's all due to the director. Don't get me wrong, Danny Boyle is a very talented filmmaker. It's just that until he finds a way to keep his more visionary instincts in check, he should stay away from movies like this one.

Honestly I thought 127 Hours was brilliant! Before beginning my opinion review on the movie I'm gonna tell the story in case some of you people have not seen the film yet and do not know the story. 127 HOURS is the incredible true story of experienced mountain climber Aron Ralston. He goes on an adventure all by himself and has not told anyone about where he was going. Soon enough a falling boulder crashes on to his arm making him trapped deep inside the canyon near Utah... Franco was simply magic and terrifying in his role. He knew perfectly well his role and he has an entertaining play. There was an excellent shot on the landscape picture of the desert and mountains. The picture was shot at a good angle and it was very stunning and pleasant to watch. The story is really good and a very special one in my opinion. Danny Boyle added so much good details in this film and I can see that he is strongly integrated for the movie-making. The scenario, artistic directions: just BRAVO! Watching the film I can feel Ralston's emotions and feelings and we get a closer look on his life-time which is a very good thing. I recommend a stronger and clearer shot for the picture. Unfortunately, there is one BIG problem about this movie. Something very important missing. Danny Boyle simply did not give us to see AND feel how Ralston's parents, girlfriends and other people feel about his disappearance and the impact it has on them. There is absolutely none of it in the film which I find very weird and perhaps even unacceptable. There could have been far more flashbacks in Ralston's past lifetime with his parents. Despite all, I recommend it to you guys who are hungry for an entertaining watch. Enjoy it. "," WAOUWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!

It tells the story about Aaron Ralston, a 27-year-old mountain climber who without telling anyone went hiking in Blue John Canyon in eastern Wayne County Utah in April, 2003. While climbing down from a fastened boulder, the rock loosened and Aron fell with it and crushed his right forearm. Stuck with his damaged arm between the boulder and the canyon knowing that no one, except two girls named Kristi and Megan who he encountered before the accident, knows about his whereabouts, Aron believes that he is going to die.Danny Boyle's engagingly directed biographical drama draws a gripping portrayal of a young man who has to utilize all of his psychical and mental strength in an attempt to overcome a situation beyond the bounds of possibility. Through an efficient flashback narrative structure, this condensed study of character visualizes and conveys the inner struggle of a man determined to find a way out of a fatal situation. While prominently focusing on one character and his experiences on the inside of a slot Canyon where the weather keeps on changing, this character-driven American-British co-production is brilliantly photographed by British cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and Ecuadorian cinematographer Enrique Chediak.The excellent score by Indian composer A.R.

That meaning would be, it doesn't matter how good you are or you might think you are, climbing is a dangerous sport don't underestimate it. Don't practice it without taking at least minimum safety measures, even if you're a real pro and you've won many medals, so you won't regret later for the rest of your life.

But on this day, he and a small boulder fall down a crevice, he landing near the bottom of the crevice virtually unharmed, but with his right hand wedged between the boulder and the crevice wall. He has access to his gear and his small supply of rations as he tries to move the boulder or chip away at it so that he can get his wedged hand free.

I am not a rhapsodic traveler at all, still I was moved by the film and by the protagonist Aron Ralston.The film deals with a quite essential proposition that when we encounter our incubus expectedly (for Aron, it was the stone, and for numerous others, it could be anything which may serve us as a hindrance), how to gather the courage, then exert reduction to practice to vanquish it eventually; the whole process is a personal sublimation for each individual as well. The one-actor setting offers James Franco a chance once in a blue moon that he could take it as his career's magnum opus. Thankfully he lives up to our expectation and delivers a energetic and vivid performance which should be concluded as powerful and splendid! I put him as my No.2 BEST ACTOR 2010 (after Jesse Eisenberg) by far. Now 2011 Oscar has just finished, Franco's sluggish state does suggest that it is a wise decision that he should never meddle with emcee anymore. I think the bloody nerve-cutting scene does persuade some potential audience from watching it, which I consider is a big loss, if one could endure the raw physiological torture (literally it only lasts several seconds at most), you will find it is worthwhile. The flashbacks & illusions after the accident happened were well-crafted, diluted the humdrum of the crack setting and enriched the character too. It is an amazing payoff as the storyline is way too thin (compared with SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE) to be scripted into a feature length film. After the overwhelming success of SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE (2008), Boyle's follow-up inherits his skillful interpretation and devotes an encouraging film which once again shows his surefooted talent to make wonders.

On the one hand, I am glad to see that his visual and narrative talent (which was underrated for a long time) was finally recognized; on the other hand, it seems that his future work will automatically be categorized as an ""Oscar competitor"" (at least for a while), something which could make him to create unreal expectations about his movies, and as a consequence, alter the perception from the spectators, who are always ready to overthrow their ""idols"". What brings me to 127 Hours, a very good drama based on a true event which comes to life under Boyle's solid direction, bringing us an interesting film experience...even though I would not consider it to be as exceptional as many people consider it to be.Before watching 127 Hours, I thought that it was going to take a similar road to the one taken by the thriller Buried, by spreading to the spectator with the claustrophobia of a character trapped into a reduced space. And Boyle achieved the atmosphere very well, because even with only an actor confined into a hole with a rock over one of his arms, the camera is always fluid and unpredictable, capturing every scene from the angle or emplacement which transmits us the biggest emotional impact (and I am not only talking about the video camera with which the main character captures his most fatalistic thoughts). In other words, 127 Hours feels as dynamic as any action film thanks to Boyle's excellent direction, which is so energetic that left me breathless during some scenes, and so precise that it does not loose even one detail from James Franco's performance, something which equally contributed to keep me interested.By the way, Franco brings a very solid performance which is worthy of the acclamation he is receiving. As for the supporting cast, I can barely mention it, because the whole movie belongs to Franco. Nevertheless, I think that Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara made an efficient work with their brief roles.However...even though I liked 127 Hours pretty much, I did not find it to be something exceptional. Its dominion of the suspense, the anguish and the emotional collapse from the main character worked for me while I was watching the movie; I also liked Boyle's direction, whose visual tricks have an emotional and narrative justification. However, I cannot deny that when the film ended, I felt the experience to have been a bit hollow and insubstantial. Nevertheless, I think that 127 Hours definitely deserves a recommendation because of its direction, performances and because it tells a very interesting story.

Sure it's graphic, but nothing not already seen in a typical torture porn film. Danny Boyle doesn't exploit this inevitable moment through lingering shots or in your face techniques, but does enough to bring forth the sheer horror and pain of the entire 127 hours ordeal that culminates with a none too pretty or neat self amputation of a limb, taking care of addressing and cutting through skin, meat, bone and tendon.Based on the memoirs of Aron Ralston's true life experience of literally being stuck between a rock and a hard place (which of course makes for a catchy book title), while I haven't read that book, Danny Boyle has weaved an incredibly fast paced picture from the get go, introducing us to Aron the weekend adventurer, who takes to the canyons for biking, climbing and exploration, played to pitch perfection by James Franco in the leading role. Quite the ladies man as well with his boyish charms and manly antics, if only to find himself never lingering at one spot, always on the go, not to allow anything to stand in his way of what could be the best weekend of his life. That is until disaster struck.When we begin from Zero hour, you can't help but feel that it's probably going to be the same with another solo, constricted space situation captured on film like Buried, which had Ryan Reynolds in a one man show buried in a box underground, and fighting for his life against his terrorist captors whom you don't see. With the camera constantly pulling to the surface of the earth just to quantify the significance of being alone and the worrying point of having nobody to contact, the narrative here doesn't get all claustrophobic on us, because Boyle made it a point for the film to be a little expansive, with various reminiscence on Aron's part, and out of body fantasy and imaginary sequences of being somewhere else other than where Aron currently is.And while that feeling of being confined is nothing new, it does make you appreciate and realize that such moments aren't far fetched, because with so many idle hours parked in between figuring out and planning how to get out, we do that idle daydream even when we're busy, so what more when we have time on our hands, with literally nowhere else to go? There's a fine balance reached where we see how Aron splits time between keeping and planning to extend his lifespan when he realizes the really deep problem he's rooted in, and that of taking time off to think about the larger picture.Which James Franco doesn't disappoint, especially when he's chronicling what could be his final hours on earth in his camcorder. He flits from being the really energetic young adult that we get introduced to, and the growingly desperate man, before basking in exuberance at the new lease of life given to him. If anyone thinks Franco is but a pretty face without substance, perhaps 127 Hours will change your mind about the actor, probably best known in his support role in Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy. It's almost like a one man show for about an hour of the film, so much of the weight of the film lies on Franco being able to convince us of the mixed emotions Aron goes through in different periods of the day and those hours, which he does.Danny Boyle continues to assert why he's one of the most versatile directors of today tackling a variety of genres, never running out of ideas to translate his vision in various films, always straddling between telling emotional stories that resonate even if the premise and set up screams commercial. A.R. Rahman, the Mozart of Madras continues in his second in as many collaboration with Boyle, providing original music that rocks from the start and defines the film, just like how his Chaiyya Chaiyya (though it was already used for Dil Se) did for Spike Lee's Inside Man.If there are messages to gain from the film, it is to always prepare for the unexpected, pack right and gather enough resources for the what ifs in life, and not to be a bastard in relationships, keeping an arm's length away from loved ones and/or taking them for granted. There could be a time where we find ourselves regretting for not doing some things while we can, so I guess it's up to us if we want to live life a day at a time while it's the last, or to idle it all away thinking we're invincible and infallible. Highly recommended film befitting of a nomination, but whether it could win with such illustrious company this year, will be a bit of a stretch.

He has half a bottle of water, a pair of wire cutters, a video camera, and nobody around to hear him.considering the hype for this film and the intensity of the premise, I was a little disappointed at the execution. To put it as literally as I can, director Danny Boyle takes a story that is potentially terrifying and he turns it into a music video. It moves too fast and contains disorienting flashbacks, clumsy cuts, over exaggerated music ques, and misuse of split screening. There is little sense of subjectivity or patience to the film. It shows a lack of faith in the attention span of its audience.James Franco is easily more vibrant than anything in his previous career, but he doesn't embody the character as well as I had hoped. I didn't sense the desperation of the situation in his performance. He plays it quiet when it should be loud, and sometimes vice versa. Another problem with the character is that Boyle cuts around him too much.As many mistakes as I felt Boyle made, He hasn't yet disappointed me as a photographer. Sunshine, Slumdog Millionaire, and even The Beach (which was slop) were vibrant and well shot. 127 Hours is easily the most vibrant of them all, making effective use of colour temperature, scope, and camera angles. One angle in particular worth noting is the intimacy of being inside Aron's video camera. There is also a memorable moment where we follow a rusty tool as it digs into his bloodstream. This brings me to my next point.The much discussed arm cutting scene is seriously over hyped. I can name a dozen films that will make you more squeamish. Therefore, if this is the reason you've chosen to avoid 127 Hours then it's the wrong reason.

127 Hours,473,Iqbali_Noodlepaste,23/May/11,10,9.319991595040789e-14,film movie one not story good will time can love make just makes may movies performances enough drama new never two first heart performance world though cast people real tale human sense compelling audience better screen cinema right might,0.5,4.0,inf,inf,inf," Some stories are built on passion, some on courage and some on hope. Very rarely do you come across a love story that encompasses itself around a journey. 127 Hours introduces us to the world of Aron Ralston, who mirrors the most innocent of sentiments which lie locked up within the depths of our heart. He wins us over in the first frame, because he is one among us. It is not his heroism which makes him real, but his vulnerability which makes him endearable. The audience falls in love with Aron Ralston because he is scared of the unknown just like us. What makes him a hero is his conviction and spirit, which makes him embark on an inner journey for the search of love and faith. It is somewhere in that journey, that you no longer root for Aron Ralston and his victory, but for his belief, which makes 127 Hours a winner right from the opening credits.His name is Ralston, Aron Ralston. Brought up in an unforgiving society, Aron battles the alternate evils of having his arm pinned down and scornful peers with equal focus, trying to make sense of the world that where gravity itself can be a friend or a deadly enemy. He goes by the doctrine of his Gran, who teaches him that there are two classes of people in the world, those who are good and would offer a lollipop and those who are bad and would point a gun. There is no caste, creed or religion but just people who shape the world. It is this philosophy which Aron carries forward in his love and faith, painting his journey in a collage of alternate light and dark emotions, shadow plays of human nature which guides him to the world or perhaps, guides the world towards him.127 Hours is appreciable because of its brilliance, acceptable for its nobility and unquestionable in its integrity. Danny Boyle weaves in a tale of love, faith, religion and humanity within a cinematic frame of 120 minutes pulling out a riveting and compelling human drama of innocence poised against the system, through the filtered sensibilities of Aron Ralston, one who cannot understand the world, but love it enough to change it. The keynotes of each frame, drenched with subtle social comments and complex emotional undertones makes the movie an amalgamation of the colors of hope and persistence, with layered textures of unspoken bonds. With Aron Ralston, Danny Boyle succeeds in bringing the system on trial through the eyes of one who cannot bias himself on any ideology, making his emotions pure and though provoking, which touches the innermost chords of the heart, moistening the eyes and serenading the senses.The story is filled with emotional subtexts which move at breakneck speed throughout the length of the film, constantly switching gears between the palettes of emotions. The dialogs exude class and confidence holding grip of the story yet laced with the finesse that allows for emotional drama combined with spiritual uprising, casting a satire on the entire system and its treatment of identities. The script penned by Danny Boyle himself, is one of par excellence, allowing the audience to blend into Aron Ralston through his smiles and tears, laugh in his joy and cringe with every blow dealt to him. The screenplay drops hypocritical moral ambitions to make scathingly relevant comments on modern outlook of the world, making it rise several notches above anything attempted before in Hollywood.In the end, 127 Hours becomes the experience it is because of James Franco, Sean Bott, Amber Tamblyn and Treat Williams, essayed flawlessly by Danny Boyle. Franco exudes the spirit of the titular ordeal in every breath and pulse of the film, putting in a performance that is beyond any benchmark of excellence. He controls every single emotional nerve of the audience with vacant stares and dimpled smiles, towering like an illusionist conjuring up a magical performance of a lifetime. He breaks every stereotypical mould attached to him to rise like a phoenix from the ashes with cohorts, who reign over the audience in a sweeping wave of emotions, establishing a bond that scales beyond the arc-lights of the 70mm screen. He is complimented by his costars whose very presence light up the entire room with just their flashing smiles. He balances the sensitivity of love and charm with the emotional conflict of a ravaged heart with effortless poise. The interactions between Franco and company form the highlights of the film, filled with the cackling chemistry of a uninhibited passion, captivating the audience in the mesmerizing spell of the couple. Kate Mara delivers a matured and restrained performance while Sean A. Bott as Aron's friend blends in simplicity with sensibility in a performance that comes straight from the heart. Kate Burton is exceptional as Aron's Mom in her mannerisms while the supporting cast all deliver credible performances including Williams in a dazzling cameo.There will always be movies that enchant us with their magic, but there will hardly be a journey that goes beyond cinematic borders to deliver the experience of a lifetime. 127 Hours is undoubtedly the new face of global cinema that enthralls with each passing frame, healing the hidden scars of the heart with its message of a better and humane world. There might be superheroes, but there will never be one James Franco, who takes pride in being ordinary and yet changes the face of the world.Earlier time scales used B.C. and A.D. to mark important events.

From an ordinary, mainstream and clich Ãd director, he rose to the status of an extraordinary genius, ring master and a leader in his style of work. It was the brilliance of 127 hours and Trainspotting that led me to understand the master at work in Slumdog. It's a film worthy of discussion, and probably can teach you as much about direction as you would learn from a month long workshop.The story deals with the real life incident of trekker Aron Ralston , played exceptionally well by James Franco, who fell into a crevice in a remote canyon in Utah as a lose boulder came off and trapped his hand in the process. In my opinion, the subject the film deals with is the hardest to recreate as you are dealing with almost one subject for the entire length of the film, and here is the hardest part __ your subject is stuck in one place. Boyle manages to do what no other director has dared or achieved to do thus far. Many survival stories have been made, but I remember none being so enigmatic and captivating for the entire duration of the film.Boyle uses several techniques from triptychs, zooming and split-screens to mash-ups and other beautiful original and inventive techniques. The challenge was to ensure that at no point, the film becomes static as the story had forced the subject to be. Audience attention span is limited and you can often lose them very quickly if nothing much transpires on screen for more than a few minutes. In this case, Boyle absolutely conscious of this fact, at all times, keeps the camera alive. There is almost a sense of desperation in the camera work, which in reality is actually conveying the trapped trekker's desperation. The film reflects what one could call Boyle's vivid and childlike imagination. In the hands of a serious story teller, this film could become another survival tale meant to pluck at those emotional strings, more suited for a Discovery Channel documentary than an hour and a half commercial relay. Boyle paints the film colorful, capturing every little detail one could possibly capture in a cramped crevice. James Franco, who has managed to raise standards for acting in survival films to a new high, is as much part of the charisma that Boyle creates with his breath-taking camera work. It is to be observed how Franco switches from a tormented trapped trekker unsure of what will happen in the next few hours to a mature, controlled and calm individual in control of the situation. Franco jokes around as though he was on television, and you can see the pain and realization, and the hopefulness lingering on his face and in his voice. Boyle does an excellent job of using, memories, flash-backs and hallucinations to build character and move the film forward.127 Hours is an achievement, a feat in itself. The very fact that such a difficult story was chosen shows extreme boldness and appetite for new challenges on part of the director. The film is arguably the best survival film I have seen. This proves so much that we don't need a lot of special effects and large budgets or exotic locations to make something worth your money. Three cheers for Danny Boyle!

I suppose it's because it's a Danny Boyle movie and he made great movies in the past such as Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire and 28 Days Later (which I all liked a lot) and this makes him a very cool director and hence you have to like this movie to be political correct or it might be because James Franco is hot and happening in Hollywood right now. It's the best explanation I can give because the movie itself is quite boring and apart from maybe one scene not really gripping or shocking.If you're stuck in a cave underground what would you be hearing? Exactly. Nothing at all! But this movie is filled with music and annoying sequences with lots of sound. I know it's supposed to represent his thoughts and mind but it does not work for me at all.James Franco as best actor nominee? I beg to differ. What does he do? He screams, he twists, he grimaces. He does that well enough but to get a nomination for best actor. Please! I have to say that technically everything in this movie is very well done. No problems there whatsoever and this is no surprise from a Danny Boyle movie.This movie's theme reminds me a lot about the novel ""Gerald's Game"" by Stephen King. I always thought that it'd be impossible to make it into a movie and nobody has tried. I haven't read the book by Aron Ralston but I guess it's the same thing. How do you even try to convey all his thoughts, fears, regrets and physical pains - which must be impossible to comprehend unless you're in the situation yourself - to the viewer? I can't really say but the way this movie does it is not the answer.If you want a harrowing tale about having your arm being trapped with nobody around to save you while your mind is playing tricks on you then read ""Gerald's Game"". It stays with you long after you've finished it. If you go to watch this movie you'd be rather bored and forget about it quickly.

""127 Hours"" follows Aron as he prepares for a great hike out in the Grand Canyon. He's confident in his abilities, with good reason, so he doesn't bother telling anyone where he's off to. Yet, even an experienced hiker, who has his head packed full of survival knowledge, can't prepare for everything.I was excited to watch this, given all of the hype. But after watching it, I can say that whatever I was expecting in this movie, just wasn't there. The movie was tedious. The first 20 minutes were all right. I enjoyed Aron's bonding time with the 2 girls and I was quite shocked and surprised after seeing the boulder fall down and crush his arm. We then see Aron pushing the rock, grunting, crying, drinking water, filming, etc. That was literally all the happened throughout the entire middle portion of the film. It got repetitive and boring! Though I admit, it makes me wonder why I just didn't stop watching. Maybe I was curious to see how it all ended.This film could have been better if the movie was shorter or if they spent some time building Aron's character. What we saw on film (from the flashbacks) was just a man who loved adventure and liked being by himself that he didn't bother telling anyone where he was heading off to. That's all I got from the flashbacks.I admit, Aron's triumph was no easy feat. I'm sure I would have given up, if I was in that position. So, congratulations to Aron! But really, they didn't have to make it into a full-length movie. Tedious and repetitive, really.Viewed on: May 5, 2011 "," James Franco plays Aron Ralston,  man  enjoys mountain climbing.

It's a film about a man being trapped in a fixed location for a little over 5 days, this is where Director Danny Boyle shows you how it can be made into a watchable 90 minute film that is worth every single cent of your ticket purchase.If you've seen how the film is made, you'd have known how much effort has been drafted into this production where a base camp is set in the middle of some wilderness and helicopters transport crew and equipment to and fro every shooting day. Cameras and their operators were set up with climbing ropes like mountaineers and one might say that this production could be one of the most demanding.So is the story and experience of Aron Ralston.Based upon the amazing true account of Ralston, this film is made in tribute to his courage to stand up against nature and allowing his will to live to outshine all adversary. Being trapped with a boulder pinning your right hand against the canyon walls inside the claustrophobic cracks of the Blue John Canyon isn't a situation that anyone will want to find themselves in.James Franco makes a terrific acting career performance and is probably by far the best we've seen of him. 127 Hours will definitely become his pivotal point as it allowed him to break free from conventional roles and portrayed one of the best sides to him that deserves watching. It's great to see him getting nods, even though people are pinning hopes on Colin Firth to eventually win. In my opinion, his rendition of Aron Ralston was very realistic and made me feel for him during the course of the film, which is what acting is all about - realism within fiction.Wait, it's more like achieving realism within realism.If you are thinking how watchable a film is when it merely depicts a man trapped within the cracks of a canyon for 127 hours under the screening time of about 90 minutes, my suggestion here to you is this.Just go watch it to immerse yourself in what is probably one of the best cinematic experience ever.Boyle has yet again proved his flair in filmmaking and it's exactly what makes him one of the best in the industry. He's already proved himself countless times especially with his previous winner ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and who doesn't love it when it took everyone by storm during its year of release?A visually stunning film that borrows from great editing and cinematography by Jon Harris and Anthony Dod Mantle/Enrique Chediak respectively. We see stylised treatment in the film with the occasional mesmerising landscapes of the canyons. Also not forgetting the original music by A.R. Rahman that made the entire 90 minutes so much more entertaining and enjoyable as a whole.127 Hours is a film that gets you deeply involved even after your step out of the theatre, thinking (or rethinking) about your life and the wonders of it. Often we tend to feel that we are in control of our lives but life is never simplistic enough for anybody to fully hold a good grasp upon. Here we see a talented Ralston who is so confident and full of life (and of himself in some manner) that he has always thought that navigating though life's mysteries and wonders under the most risky situations would be the best after-dinner desserts he could possibly have.That was before the element of nature came into play.Under the power of nature, man is belittled to a tiny speck of existential form as seen here in 127 Hours. Drastic climatic conditions, lack of food and water supply, lack of sleep, claustrophobic location, and eerie silence during most parts of the days and nights. What keeps a man going here will be his determination and will to live and survive. We see him talking to his video camcorder most of the times, his only companion to converse with that is also probably what keeps him sane.Ralston performs the unimaginable feat of severing his own right forearm, which is graphically portrayed in this film without ever showing much of him actually doing it through editing (it's a little gruesome in thought but if that's what bothering you, it's not a reason worth to skip this film). What's horrible rather, is the sound that we hear during the controversial scene, which brings one much closer to realism than the sight of it.So it's a battle between nature, Ralston, and his will to live, and it's one that you shouldn't miss for any reason at all.

What lengths will he go to in order to survive? The story is familiar to anyone who has followed the news in the last ten years. But here we are given a closer look than we ever thought possible. And if you are wondering if it is possible to make a film about a man who does not move and has no one to talk to for 127 hours, it can be done, and be done in style.I do not think Danny Boyle was the right man for the job on this one. Not to say he did a bad job -- he did not -- but he has a unique style that I think this film did not need. There are a lot of colorful things that need not be there.

If so, why not introduce the character showing him giving good advice to customers (i.e., don't hike alone, tell family and friends where you're going, etc.) and then contrast that with his own rash behavior as he set off alone.And we never see the incident from another's perspective, such as the rescue personnel, the doctors, or even the hikers who discover the injured man. Why not build up the moment when hikers come across the injured Ralston. As audience members, we can never know Ralston's pain and suffering, but we can put ourselves in the place of the hikers who found and helped Ralston. Their shock, horror, and confusion, would be palpable and understandable, but instead those people are just an afterthought.

I'll admit that when I first heard the news that someone had a literal panic attack during the screening at Telluride, I was super excited to see it, as it could only have meant that the film was truly genuine and amazing. My assumptions were correct, as Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy (who also wrote the Slumdog Millionaire script with the director) put together another great film, this time with the challenge of one actor on screen for the entire movie. For those of you unfamiliar with the movie, 127 Hours tells the story of real life climber Aron Ralston (Franco) and his struggle to survive after his arm gets trapped under a boulder while mountaineering near Moab, Utah. Going into a film like this, one would wonder how a movie with one actor and essentially one filming location could entertain an audience for about 90 minutes. Well, Danny Boyle did an excellent job of keeping people glued to the screen without taking away from the film and boring audience members. With his funky style of directing, amazing camera shots, as well as his ability to bring so much information and life into a one man show, Boyle tackled this daunting task beautifully. The directors uses of Ralston's fantasies, hallucinations, comedic relief, and the character's will to live all helped keep audience members interested, and wondering how and when this man would survive such an catastrophe. Now to the leading man of the film, James Franco. I will admit, before this film I had never seen Franco give an awe-inspiring performance in any film really, but 127 Hours was his calling card. People should take notice, because this guy can really hold his own both on screen and off. Franco gave a fantastic performance in this one, and really made the character of Aron Ralston believable to the audience (which is what good actors do). He played the role seriously, but also gave the audience the much needed comedic relief, evening out the intensity of the film with a little bit of good humor. This isn't an easy role to portray for any actor, and it seemed as though Franco tackled it with ease, playing a disgruntled and challenging Ralston, and the different moods and emotions he feels while being trapped. I would be insane not to give credit to both Simon Beaufoy and Danny Boyle for writing another excellent screenplay. Unlike their previous film, Slumdog Millionaire, which was an excellent screenplay, this one stands out more simply because of the limitations they had when writing it. Essentially, it was a dialogue prepared for one man to speak to himself for about 80 minutes, mostly through his hand-held video camera.This movie is getting the granny apple A it deserves; the combination of great directing, writing, and an amazing performance by James Franco, truly make this film a remarkable one. The ability to overcome challenges and limitations, like Boyle did in this film, is what I believe separates the great directors from the good ones. Furthermore, the pace, intensity, suspense, and even Boyle's added humor, all add to the amalgamation of this films success. The films funkiness, brilliance, and realism faze out the idea that there is only one actor on screen sitting in the same location for almost the entirety of the film.

It works in 127 Hours initially __ during the opening cross country scenes, with the ironic camera swooping across the landscape not to find some undiscovered wonder, but Aron Ralston (James Franco). As Ralston approaches the gorge that will become his living tomb, the editing ratchets further, and the tension mounts. Yet it never STOPS ratcheting. Even as Ralston's poignant premonitions begin, of the son he may never have, Boyle is intent on pummelling our senses with colour and sound, never allowing us to settle into the lonely mundanity; the grey, endless dread. We're left with a breezy comic book descent into an unconvincing hell.The decision to depict Ralston as smug and vacuous is admirable, although given that he now commands an eye-watering honorarium for motivational speeches in real life, it would seem that this is a character rainbow at whose end has not been found the Church of Humility.Perhaps there is an underlying commentary on these narcissistic times here: the notion that Ralston may have taken the final, gory step towards survival out of a semi-conscious desire for celebrity. Even his heartfelt message to his folks (probably the film's best scene) is performed as a brash American talk show. Boyle and co-writer Simon Beaufoy, with their premonitory promises of a selfless paternal utopia, do their best to (ostensibly) scupper this suggestion; but the smell still lingers, not least because they've, well, made a film about the guy. There's a self-fulfilling irony here that's hard to comprehend.The film serves as companion piece to Slumdog Millionaire, insofar as Boyle bleeds a heart-warming story from the bleakest of backdrops, building the narrative from grizzly horror, through drippy sentimentality, to orgasmic frenzy. The tonal shifts in 127 Hours might be slightly less jarring than the former film, but the aftertaste is no less tooth-rotting.On the occasions the editing settles we glimpse a fine performance from Franco, although less varied and witty than Ryan Reynolds' in Rodrigo Cortes's Buried. Come to think of it, Cortes's film summons more excitement, humour and pathos from the confines of a single box than 127 Hours can muster with all its gimmicks.

Directed, co-written and produced by Danny Boyle, and starring James Franco as real-life cayoneer Aron Ralston, I thought that Danny Boyle didn't do a bad job with this film. The only other Boyle film which I have seen (besides 127 Hours) is 28 Days Later, which will definitely come off as a shock, seeing that I have still not seen Trainspotting or Slumdog Millionaire. Nonetheless, moving on with the movie...Plot-wise...it's kind of hard to actually call this a plot. I mean, the movie is basically about this guy who gets stuck a bit underground by a huge rock while canyoning. Being based off a true story, you would wonder how accurate this movie is to the source material, and from all the research I've done, this movie is actually pretty accurate! Aron Ralston himself has stated that this movie is almost completely accurate (besides the part when he's showing the two girls the hidden pool). And this is always a good thing when you are doing movies based on true stories.Getting into what I liked and didn't like about the movie, I thought that almost everything was great. One of the main issues of the film is that there just isn't much dialog being said, and this is due to the main character being trapped by himself with no one to share dialog with, and getting into what I didn't like about the film, I didn't like the way they kept on swapping from present to all the flashbacks with Ralston and his family and all of that that they did in the film to actually provide us with something. Now I know that this is based on a true story and this is actually what happened (the main character being trapped by himself), but this also makes you question whether this should just have been a documentary instead of an actual film.Overall, the film didn't really bug me that much besides the time when they kept on switching back and forth with the time line and showing all those flashbacks, but besides that, mostly everything was good. James Franco's performance in this movie was awesome (he deserved the Oscar nomination), truly showing us how Aron Ralston was a man of true courage and had endless passion to get out of the situation he was in. Cinematography was good, sound editing was good, directing was good, acting was good, and this is a film which I would highly recommend to people who are interested in a good movie based on a true story, and a good movie in general! 7/10 ","  just finished watching 127 Hours,   pretty pleased   movie.

I decided to watch it after seeing some of the reviews on the internet and because people generally say it's one of the best films of 2010.The film is based on an impressive true story of Aron Ralston who's arm got trapped in a canyon by a huge stone after a clumsy and unfortunate fall. He was stuck for 127 HOURS and was forced to take extreme measures to survive...by amputating his trapped arm himself with a small blade. The story itself is amazing so that wasn't my concern initially. My concern was how is it supposed to be turned into an enjoyable movie, which won't backfire on itself. There wasn't really much going on. Most of the film basically revolves around Aron Ralston being trapped there all alone. How did this movie turn out to be so good then? Two reasons.First, directing. I haven't watched Danny Boyle's films, so I didn't know what kind of directing to expect. After watching this, I can say that he did a great job. He effectively captured some of the crucial scenes of the movie and he's done it in a way that the film doesn't get too dull at times.Second, good casting. James Franco did his job perfectly. He displayed great acting during, well, the whole film. I could feel what he was going through and how much he had wanted to just get out of there. Those kind of situations really make you reflect on your whole life and what you've done up to that point, what you could have done and what you want to accomplish before you die. You learn what's really important to you and you realize how little it takes to lose a chance to go on. I mean, he almost lost his life because of a moment of clumsiness and a stone! Franco did well to portray all these emotions. The scene where he cuts his arm made me cringe in my couch! When he got to the nerve...not for everyone, I can tell you that. I gained a lot of respect for Ralston after seeing that. (and I already had a hell lot of respect for the man!) Overall, a pleasant surprise!I wouldn't go as far as to say that it's the best of 2010., but it's in the top ten for sure.

He's created unique examples of what are possible with both the horror and science fiction genres (at times blending the two), and he's tackled the grim reality of humanity in his Oscar-winning film Slumdog Millionaire. It should come as no surprise, then, that 127 Hours is a beautifully filmed, expertly nuanced story about what fuels both delirium and perseverance.The movie is based on a true story. In 2003, canyoneer Aron Ralston decided to embark on a weekend hike in a mountainous region of Utah. After miscalculating a step while traversing a crevice, Aron fell down a sheer embankment and had his arm pinned against the cliff face by an oblong boulder. As you'd expect, a previously happy-go-lucky situation turns gruesome in a split-second, and, to make matters worse, it's only a matter of time before Aron depletes his limited supply of water and prepackaged goodies.A misconception that seems to linger about 127 Hours is that exists for the singular ""gross out"" moment__you know, when our protagonist realizes his only chance of escape is to whittle away at this trapped arm until a bloody stump is all that remains. In fact, Boyle's film is more focused on Aron's life leading up to the accident, which is wrought with the misgivings of someone who's been much too selfish. As it turns out, it would take something as drastic as facing a life or death situation for Aron to come to grips with his passive-aggressive abandonment of everyone he's ever cared for.By allowing us into the mind of our lead we're able to experience how a dehydration-fueled delirium brought to light the things in Mr. Ralston's life that actually matter. So integral are these hallucinations that it's sometimes difficult to separate what Aron is really going through as opposed to what's taking place in his mind, but Boyle expertly balances his tale by bringing Aron (and the audience) back to reality when things seem to be utterly lost in a maze of all-too-tangible illusions.Besides the thematic victories that are embodied in 127 Hours, it's also __quite simply__a movie that's very easy on the eyes. The rolling canyons and red plains make for a stunning backdrop, and the horror unfolding in the small crack Aron inhabits serves as an effective juxtaposition to the sprawling beauty that's just beyond his reach (figuratively, literally, etc.).In short, Boyle strikes again. Pay the $10 for a ticket and catch this one before it leaves theaters.Trust me. It's worth it.

Considering a great deal of this movie features only one character, Boyle (along with Simon Beaufoy) worked wonders with the screenplay. As you can imagine, special effects were almost non-existent. I think the only time we saw special effects were during Ralston's brief hallucination spells. The lack of special effects made the film all the more real, and realness is something seriously missing from modern films.

Aron is a lover of canyon climbing and the outdoors. Back in 2003, on one of his trips to the Utah canyons, he got stuck when a boulder fell on his arm. He was immobile for 127 hours until he made a bold decision of cutting off his arm. He never informed anyone where he was going much less brought a phone. We cannot entirely blame Aron for this__bad things happen to people, especially when alone in the mountainous wilderness.This film by British filmmaker Danny Boyle goes in-depth with this remarkable yet ludicrous true story. James Franco plays Aron as a happy-go-lucky, charismatic guy. Even in peril, he knows how to make the audience laugh, cry, and even move them. This performance is definitely Franco's crown jewel and his Oscar nomination was well earned. The style of story and filmmaking is perfect for Mr. Boyle. The use of choppy editing, jump cuts, overexposed lighting, time lapses, and occasional bursts of loud sound effects and music is reminiscent of his past works. It fits well for this kind of movie. The majority of the film takes place in the canyon where Aron is trapped. To keep it going, hallucinations and flashbacks are added as Aron struggles to survive. This works for a while but after an hour it becomes dull. No doubt it is hard to do a movie about one man's survival__look no further than Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away."" The problem with these kinds of films is that it goes on longer than necessary and incoherent flashbacks are used as an excuse to add sympathy for the character. I am not saying ""127 Hours"" is a bad movie. It is a decent one. But for 94 minutes, it drags on like a three-hour film. This may have been intentional to emphasis the seemingly endless time that Aron suffers. But when I start to see subliminal cuts of Scooby Doo and Gatorade commercials, I have reached my limit.""127 Hours"" is not a movie for everyone. The big critics love it and the mindless masses find it distasteful. In my opinion, it is neither. It is good, but not great. I will forewarn that the amputation scene is one of the goriest moments I have ever seen in cinema__and I sat through ""The Passion of the Christ"". This is definitely not for the faint of heart.

First of all it's a true story giving the audience a very personal experience and view into what Aaron Ralston experienced. I wasn't a story made up to be exciting and thrilling. It's not fiction, it's REAL life. And in real life someone trapped under a rock for 127 hours would probably talk to themselves, reminisce, fantasize, hallucinated, and either reach a point of complete insanity as to cut off his own arm to get free, or die because he gave up and felt completely hopeless. While I watched this movie I recall how I felt when I was held captive in a room for nine months in another country with an abusive husband. I left the US with him and went to Mexico, being a loyal wife, as he ran from imprisonment. It was there he went crazy on me and began to abuse me because he was losing his mind and knew I missed my family and regretted leaving with him and out of my loyalty and trying to protect him, when at the time I believed he was innocent of his crime, I never told my family where I was and never called them when I was there. Then, he locked me in a room and beat me and starved me. How does my story relate to this in anyway? You might ask. It is just simply the human experience of being alone and having to fight for your life. I don't know what's worse, being completely in the middle of nowhere with no human contact whatsoever and wishing for just one person to see you and immediately gain hope you will be rescue somehow. Or, being trapped by another human being who at any moment will decided to take your life if you don't fight for it the the best way you know how. I survived. I was,'t rescued. It took drastic measures to make my escape with nothing but the shirt on my back. Five years later I have a happy life of freedom and I know I could be dead now if I didn't fight for my life. All the feelings Aaron has in this movie I experienced and that's why it moved me. I was in tears when Aaron apologizes for not answering his mom's calls. I was the same way. You NEVER know what life might hand you and NO ONE can escape to possibility that your life may take a sudden turn and everyone has things they might want to have done or not done if faced with a life or death situation. So for everyone who was bored, go watch something else. This isn't meant to be exciting. It's meant to make you see what a man went through and have he survived.Yes he made some dumb decisions. No phone, no GPS. But real human beings do stupid stuff sometimes don't we? Why fault the film and call it stupid? This is what happen to him. It's his story. Period. I loved this film, and every time I forget what really matters in life, I watch it to remind me just how precious life and family and friends who care about you really are.

Not just an excuse for shock value, the movie is basically about the will to survive in the most dire situations. The movie is also about how Ralston changes. Starting out as a footloose, extreme mountain climber, his humanity becomes apparent as he realizes that there's only one way out of his predicament.James Franco plays Ralston to a tee, showing the man start to go delirious as he eventually decides on drastic measures. Much of the credit also goes to cinematographers Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak, who create just about every angle in the confined space where Ralston finds himself trapped by the boulder, emphasizing his feeling of desperation.All in all, if ever there was a movie about the triumph of the human spirit, this has to be it.

Yet he records every moment along the way with his camcorder and camera, he chronicles his journey as if he just wanted everyone to live through his every adventure and be able to tell the story: I survived this, I survived that...After parting ways from a couple of very attractive young girls who were lost in the wilderness of this beautiful and astonishing park, Aron decides to take a shortcut back to his truck in order to get ready to party with these girls later on that evening. There's all these cracks in the mountain that allow very little space to go through it, it's like being caught inside a giant maze where there's no safe way out unless you're as experienced as Aron is. His confidence allows him to jump as a jaguar from rock to rock without care... Until the unthinkable happens.He falls along with a giant boulder that pretty much smashes his hand and forearm and traps him in the middle of nowhere. His initial reaction is to scream for help but as the camera zooms out we realize it's almost impossible for anyone to hear him. He's literally caught between a rock and a hard place as his self titled book is called and he must find a way to chip away from this boulder to free his hand and arm from the boulder.What I most liked about the movie is not so much the fact that he had to resort to drinking his own urine, or the fact we were witnessing a man severing his own arm to liberate himself and find his way back home. It's more interesting to focus in what was going through his mind while he was trapped all this time alone in the freezing cold temperature, suspended up in the air with little food and water to sustain himself. I think what came through at the end was a man who recovers himself, a person who's forced to look at himself and see how selfish he's been, how he's shut out everyone in his life to pursue these adventures. He was destined to fall at that precise time, in that precise place as he himself describes it: ""You know, I've been thinking. Everything is... just comes together. It's me. I chose this. I chose all this. This rock... this rock has been waiting for me my entire life. It's entire life, ever since it was a bit of meteorite a million, billion years ago. In space. It's been waiting, to come here. Right, right here. I've been moving towards it my entire life. The minute I was born, every breath that I've taken, every action has been leading me to this crack on the out surface."" Aron Ralston Sometimes, we have to go through a tragedy, a harrowing experience of this kind to realize how precious our lives are. As Aron was cutting through his arm in his last attempt at making it out of there alive a vision of his unborn child was presented to him. People may not believe this is a sign that God exists, but Aron did. There are moments in one's life where we have to stop and thank Him for opening our eyes, if just for a little bit, to realize how much we are loved and appreciated and how we depend on others and how others depend on you.On more than one occasion I have stopped and thought: what would have happened if I hadn't gone there, if I hadn't taken the chance, if I hadn't listened... Where would I be? I thank God that I had a chance to open up my eyes and see what was in front of me, kick myself in the ass and move on with my life... God works in very mysterious ways and it's in the darkest moments that we find the light.We all carry this boulder on our shoulders, we just gotta know when to let it go...

On his feet, inside his car, riding his bike, the man refuses to stay still, which must have made things all the more difficult for the man who cuts his hair. These moments are accompanied by Danny Boyle's eminent style of directing. I am not sure how to describe it, but it can sure make the sight of James Franco riding a bike feel exhilarating. Through the right use of quick cuts and split screens, Boyle signifies the wild nature of Ralston. He keeps moving, and moving, and moving, until he slips, and comes to a halt.

Both these movies are agonizing and make the spectator feel very sorry for the main character, even thought the protagonist never showed a reason for us to like him. My main complaint about ""127 Hours"" is that Franco, in many scenes, seems to be TOO calm for someone who is that close to death; when people are about to die they simply get crazy-- our survival's instinct attacks. The photography direction is beautiful, this picture is surely a professional work; it's just a shame that films involving this trouble will never be completely entertaining-- it will get boring eventually.

After 6 days he realises he is going to have to take drastic action to ensure his escape. I felt this film was a bit of a mixed bag. Certainly the story felt very unnerving and haunted me long after the film had finished, this was due to the film capturing very well the isolation of the place Aron was trapped in. I also think the film did a very good job of highlighting what an idiot Aron was for getting into that predicament and how selfish he must have been around the time. It did this without making us dislike him too much, so I think it made a good balance out of his character. But I wasn't actively rooting for him as such, 1 - because I knew what happens anyway, and 2 - because whilst I'd not wish that on anyone, it's hard to root for him as it all transpires through his own foolishness, and there's a near infinite list of people who have met an untimely demise through no fault of their own. So we might perhaps consider them more 'deserving' of our sympathies. James Franco did a rather workmanlike job as Aron, showing he kept his head well in spite of what happened, and rallied himself for an escape on day 6 despite his weak and delusional state. But I felt disconnected from his character, in fairness this could be the direction, as Boyle is somewhat patchy IMO. The camera-work was excellent regarding the scenery and it really did ram home how desolate that place is and how insignificant a speck of nothingness is a human being, I thought that aspect of the film was superb. The editing however, good god...It was like MTV gone mad! I realise it's incredibly hard to make an engaging 90 min film with only one character, but the constant hallucinations and flashbacks with split-screen effect, well that was such a cheap way out of it and smacked of very immature film-making. A better director could have made that film work without any of the cheap gimmicks, because the story is highly unsettling and the stuff from which edge of your seat tension could be made, in the right hands. There is no message to the film, despite what anyone will tell you. It merely shows us that people are capable of tremendous deeds when their life is on the line - this is already well documented, and that human hubris can get you into trouble, again this is very well documented and I am sure many of us know this from our own experience. So, whilst I enjoyed certain aspects of the film, it was somewhat unfulfilling - certainly it's no 'Alive' or 'Touching the Void' - but I think this was down to the directing and nasty editing for the MTV generation.

""127 Hours"" is a movie about a man named Aron Ralston, an everyday guy with a passion for mountain climbing and anything outdoors, who winds up stuck on the line between life and death- or rather, between freedom and a boulder. He is pinned by his arm against a canyon wall and has to take a stab at surviving. It is based on a true story.I have a lot of respect for Danny Boyle. I have always loved his style of directing, so I was keen to see what his next project would be after ""Slumdog Millionaire"" swept the Oscars in 2008. I had heard this story many times before, so I was instantly interested in how Boyle would turn this tragic story into a big screen movie. He did not disappoint. One of my favorite things about the movie is that Danny Boyle stayed really close to the actual story. The real Aron Ralston said so himself that the movie is as accurate as you can get while still being a drama.Boyle made the right choice in bringing back A. R. Rahman to score the movie. The music is what completed the movie, in more ways than it would affect other movies because of the situation. There are scenes that portray just plain emotion, and the music adds a whole new level of depth to these scenes. The soundtrack is chilling, yet so beautiful.Casting-wise, James Franco was perfectly cast as Aron Ralston. I was a fan before, but this movie doubled my respect for him. His performance was astonishing and completely believable.Before I watched this movie, questions were floating in my head. Will this whole movie take place in the canyon? Will it be boring? Will it be sickening? No, no, and yes. About 70-75% of the movie does take place inside the canyon, but it does not get boring. Flashbacks and hallucinations fill up some time here, but during this portion of the movie (in the canyon), you feel as if you are in there yourself or that Aron is talking to you personally. The movie is very intimate. That even applies to the squeamish moments. There IS a lot of blood. Do not be surprised if you find yourself looking away from the screen at some parts (I could not help it).While watching this movie, I felt anticipation. I felt fear. I felt. optimism. I laughed. I cried. This movie truly is the whole package. I highly recommend everyone to see this movie at some point in their life.

I can say this about many films that I have disliked, but this it the first time I can say that about a film I really thought was great.It is so real, almost like a documentary. They wanted to cast Cillian Murphy for their first choice as the lead. All I can say is thank god for that failing, and Franco taking the part. Nothing against Murphy, but this is one of those films where the lead just nails it perfectly. I could not imagine any other actor doing as well as Franco in this role. There are quite a few films where the first choice fell through, and the second or third choice just nailed it. Brando was second choice for The Godfather! They wanted Lawrence Olivier, but he was too old and sick to commit to it.In any case, this film could not have been done any more brilliantly, honestly and accurately. The first scene with the two girls was ""Hollywoodized"" but the rest of the film is dead on accurate. Ralston said so himself. The Southwest is amazing, I have lived there and hiked a fair amount of it. The scene with the electrical storm was perfect. I have seen week after week, month after month, of nothing but sunshine, cloudless skies, and beautiful, consistently dry, sunny weather- And then an electrical storm from hell, will form out of nowhere, and hit brutally hard in less than 20 minute's time.

I love the idea that movies of this nature rely on the talent of the performer and not so much on action, special effects, etc. Celebrated filmmaker Danny Boyle adapts the true life story of adventurous outdoorsman Aron Ralston. Ralston has been quoted in regards to the accuracy of the film as saying it's as close as you can get to a documentary while still being a narrative film. Ralston is known for a disastrous adventure into the canyons of Utah in which he was doing some hiking and, after a nasty fall, found himself trapped with a boulder pinning his arm to the canyon wall. For the following couple of days, Ralston documented his experience with his small video camera and survived on what little food he'd brought and a dwindling water supply. The end of the film has become famous for the extreme lengths Ralston had gone to to free himself from the canyon. I'm sure everyone knows how the film ends by this point, but in the event that someone reading this is oblivious, I'll avoid mentioning it. Needless to say, it's pretty painful to watch.Before 127 HOURS, I'd only known actor James Franco as Harry Osborn from Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN trilogy and a spaced-out pot dealer in PINEAPPLE EXPRESS. I was more than a little skeptical that Franco, who I hadn't seen in any serious sort of role, could pull off carrying a dramatic picture by himself. But I suppose I should've given director Danny Boyle the benefit of the doubt that he knew what he was doing. Franco does a great job. He's a talented man, and his work in 127 HOURS proves it. Over the course of Ralston's time trapped in the canyon, Franco runs the gamut from determined and hopeful to ready for the inevitable and he does such a fine job that he brings the audience along with him. Ralston's constant updates into his camcorder give us some insight into what he's going through, seeing as how he has no one to talk to. Franco is powerful as he reaches out to his parents whom he knows won't receive his message until after he's found (most likely too late). He reminisces back to mistakes he's made and moments he regrets, his entrapment giving him a new view on life.Now yes, Danny Boyle is a great director but I know what's most likely to be the bigger selling point for the film is the final act in which Ralston gets down to business when he realizes what he's going to need to do to survive his predicament. Even those who've been desensitized to violence might have a hard time not flinching. It's not overdone and a lot of it is done off screen, but it's done incredibly well and has the audience grimacing. Keep in mind, this even doesn't happen until the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. So if it's your sole reason for inquiring into the film, you'll want to get comfortable and settle in for one of the best movies of 2010 in the meantime.

He screams, ""This is insane!"" as we all would, because in this modern world, things like this not only don't happen to us, but CAN'T happen to us. Like the abandoned couple in OPEN WATER, we think we're too technological, too evolved, too sophisticated for these menial mishaps. Ralston peers up at the sliver of blue sky above the gulch and sees a faraway plane. It's surreal that in this world overrun by people, not one other soul knows where he is...He thinks back to his last hours in civilization; how he didn't pick up his mother's call, how he didn't tell his co-worker where he was going, and even how he misplaced his Swiss army knife, saddled instead with a cheap multi-tool, which would have to go above and beyond its call of duty to pull off a gory task.He starts a filmic commentary on his vidcam, one of his first ruminations that his hand has not had circulation for 24 hours, ""It's probably gone."" Horrifying thought! Even if you did escape now, that part of your body is destroyed irrevocably. Then the corollary thought: how long can the rest of your body maintain with one part of it slammed off from regular function? The blood is being squeezed through forcibly-created pathways to avoid that dead junction - how long before the machine busts a piston? On the third day, Ralston starts talking of his heart palpitating three times faster than normal.He starts conserving his food (2 burritos) and water (1 flask); jerry-rigs an ingenious sling to try to shift the rock; chips away at the stone with the multi-tool. He dreams... of his ex-girlfriend, of parties, of being freed - and wakes to stone-cold reality (isn't that the worst, stomach-curdling feeling in the world?); noises in the dark, delirium, wild thoughts...Director Danny Boyle is intent on making us feel everything Ralston felt, force-feeding us his emotional arc, through periods of sanguinity and desperation, frivolity and fear, and his ultimate descent into insanity and then clarity and then a hybrid of both; after all, how insane/sensible do you have to be to realize your only option is to break both the bones in your forearm and carve it off to escape? James Franco goes where few actors have been - no, not down a gulch in Utah - into the mind of a man who calmly assessed self-mutilation for survival. And went through with it! Of course, our own primal fears were awakened long before Ralston made the decision. It is WE who are trapped, it is WE who will die slowly or risk brain-searing pain, and ultimately... it is WE whose arms Ralston is cutting into! Boyle and Franco take us there, capturing not just the mental state, but (with the jolting use of fizzling audio and red meat editing) also capturing that ineffable yet jarringly familiar sensation of electric, teeth-fraying pain, as Ralston cuts through his tendons, nerves exposed. At that point, we would welcome fingernails down a blackboard.When his arm comes away and he stumbles backwards - that blank look - it's like his brain has fried its last cell trying to process what he has just done. What was going through Ralston's mind at that point in real life? The brain as an organ assessing how to cope with a body part suddenly non-existent on its radar? Ralston retained enough peace of mind to apply a tourniquet before the cutting got too deep, retained enough sanity to take one last picture of his cut-off arm; had enough strength to then rappel down a cliff face and walk in the direction of his car before coming across hikers and being rescued.Astonishingly, Ralston retained consciousness through his rescue and hardly even had to be helped walking; a testament to the human body's resilience, that's how fit and/or adrenalized he was. Ralston made it because he was in peak human condition from his extreme sports escapades. It's got nothing to do with his ""soul"" or fighting spirit or that stupid ""premonition"" of his future son.From Ralston's book, Between a Rock and a Hard Place, 127 HOURS is pure visceral emotion. It will leave you spent, if you haven't fainted first. The film's coda shows us the real Aron Ralston with wife Jessica - sitting in the sun, relaxed, quiet. A welcome relief from the foregoing intensity. Ralston continues to climb and trek; we see a prosthetic climbing apparatus attached to his missing limb.Still, the most incredible, inspirational thing I took from Ralston was how he kept his three-day growth as a three-day growth over five days. If I could do that, I would be soooo sexy.

I thought to myself how could the tale of a man being trapped by a rock be thrilling. But i was proved wrong. Danny Boyle has once again outdone himself. His creativity has turned something which could have been very average into a great piece of cinema.I loved this film from the first second to the last. The first quarter of an hour or so before Aron (James Franco)gets trapped is as well made as the rest of it. Although arguably having little relevance to the main plot this prelude perfectly shows Aron's buzzing character. The majority of this film though takes place in the canyon where Aron gets trapped. From this point the audience is thrust into a thrilling battle for survival. James Franco expertly portrays the emotions of his character who at first thinks its crazy that he has got himself into his situation but who then quickly realizes that he will have to fight for his life.We slowly see Aron's degression into a delusional state as time goes on. Boyle cleverly interjects memories from Aron's life to both take a break from the character's ordeal but mainly to give more depth to his character. We both see positive memories such as scenes with his Dad when he was a child but also negative memories such as with his former girlfriend who says he will be lonely forever. There is one great scene where he pretends to be on a morning talk show which shows his anger, idiocy and ability to make jokes in his horrific situation all at once.As his desperation increases we see him being freed from the rock in a storm however Boyle quickly makes it apparent that this was just a dream or a delusion emphasizing the reality of his situation. Then finally he has to decide whether to die or cut himself free. In a scene realistic but not too gruesome we see himself hack through his own arm in agony, finally after immense pain freeing himself (this time for real)from the rock.This film concludes by showing the real Aron Ralston who said himself that this film was so realistic it could have been a documentary. It is definitely a must see, both Franco and Boyle deserved Oscar wins. ","   saw  film's trailer    say   not  excited  seeing .  thought      tale   man  trapped   rock  thrilling.    proved wrong.

Therefore, the film doesn't drag, plus there was lots of bustling conversation between my family and my self when watching this film revolving around the many different ways in which he does try to free himself and the inevitable discussions about how or what we would do if placed in a similar or the exact same situation ourselves.

A story of remarkable human resilience, Boyle and star James Franco make an involving and personal film about a man versus the elements.The film tells the true story of Aron Ralston, a professional rock climber. On this particular weekend, he decides to go to the desert without telling anyone where he is going. After biking for 17 miles, he runs into two girls__the last people to see him while he still had his forearm. After going their separate ways, Ralston continues hiking through canyons. While going into one, a boulder slips from under his feet and his right arm becomes pinned between the boulder and the wall of the canyon. This is where the movie really begins.Essentially a one man show, James Franco gives the best performance of his career as the man caught between a rock and a hard place. His slow descent into hopelessness, madness, and finally, assertiveness, is sadistically fun to watch. Even if it is hard to sympathize with a cocky rock climber, as the movie progresses. Franco's character becomes more and more identifiable, eventually coming to embody any one of us who has gone through painful decisions and excruciating circumstances. Franco gives his character a mixture of warmth, strangeness, and__when he cuts his own arm off__complete baddass-ness.Danny Boyle gives it his all with this brutal account of survival. It's a hard thing to get right, making a movie that almost entirely takes place in one small spot; but Boyle triumphs. The bloody and gut- wrenching amputation scene will have even the most jaded movie goer squirming in their seats. Yet, what makes this movie great is the warmth and sentiment Boyle places at the heart of this film. Our character looks back on his life, family, and ex-girlfriend. And he even has a vision of his future son. Boyle is able to take a bleak and bitter tale of survival, and turn it into a glorious film of hope and beauty. The movie is beautifully photographed by Anthony Mantle, with saturated colors that almost engulf us into the desert.Still, the film belongs to Franco. His Oscar-worthy performance is the centerpiece of 127 Hours. Although Boyle sometimes strays into predictability, and the arbitrary split-screen editing is unnecessary at best, the movie is so involving that you'll forget you're even in the theater. The music, cinematography, and directing all come together to make this movie one of the best of the year.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com "," Danny Boyle's film based  real events      horrifying, explicit,  oftentimes heartwarming movie.  story  remarkable human resilience, Boyle  star James Franco make  involving  personal film   man versus  elements.The film tells  true story  Aron Ralston,  professional rock climber.   particular weekend,  decides  go   desert without telling anyone    going.  biking  17 miles,  runs  two girls__the last people  see    still   forearm.  going  separate ways, Ralston continues hiking  canyons.  going  one,  boulder slips  under  feet   right arm becomes pinned   boulder   wall   canyon.     movie really begins.Essentially  one man show, James Franco gives  best performance   career   man caught   rock   hard place.  slow descent  hopelessness, madness,  finally, assertiveness,  sadistically fun  watch.

I limn my take-away here. Some people have described the movie as escapist entertainment. Normally averse to such cheap cinematic productions, I had to have my arm twisted to go. While I expected it to be finger-tappingly dull--or having me climbing the walls after a few minutes, it turned out to be the gripping story of a man whose pursuit of adventure suddenly finds himself in a grave position.When the gravity of his sudden change in environment dawns on him, our protagonist is, at first, laughingly frustrated, but, ... he soon grasps the severity of his situation. Armed only with a cheap knife, some climbing equipment, and the will to succeed, he is hard pressed to figure out his path to freedom; and, like Atlas, the situation weighs heavily upon him. Finally, after running out of water, and having deep doubts, he reaches for a solution, and plumbing the deep recesses of his mind, he realizes that his liberty had been right at his fingertips all along. Extricating himself from his plight will be hard, and the viewer will witness some petrifying moments and excruciating scenes that are so alarmingly vivid you could cut the tension they create with a knife.Wedged between love for himself ... and a second chance, in a series of flashbacks and hallucinations, he comes to a psychological realization and finally makes the lacerating decision to break away from his worldy attachments. These scenes cut a little close to the bone and are nerve fraying, but I'm glad I hung in there, because it was worth it.Some scenes will rock you, and the twists and turns increase the tension scene after scene. Still, the film is disarmingly well made, and severs the ever-present connection between the self--and the goal of the self that is beyond reach. In essence, it is about the separation between the possible and the impossible. The drama is riveting and had me pinned to my seat. It is a wrenching story, from which you will be unable to tear yourself away.I can only count on the fingers of my two hands the movies that I would recommend this heartily. I applaud the filmmakers-- and actor, whose dexterity and hands-on approach, made the film the cutting edge drama that it is.Borrowing the universally recognized hand signals from Siskel & Ebert, I give it two thumbs up.Give up those things that are holding you back from witnessing this work of art; break away from your usual routine; go see this cinematic marvel before it leaves theaters.I would be hard pressed to to recommend a more grounded film.

The unthinkable happens when he falls down a canyon and his arm become pinned by a boulder. He is trapped down there for five days struggling to survive going through some desperate measures one should never have to contemplate.I've heard many say 127 is stupid, and just a boring film. They obviously have no appreciation for great scenery and a very involved soundtrack. The film is scored by Slumdog Millionaire's A.R. Rahman. Rahman is perhaps most famous from his song Jai Ho, which is a great motivating song. He scores this movie to perfection and intensity.In a way I have sympathy for Ralston, and I don't. You're not the brightest of bulbs if you go out to a canyon and bring or tell no one. I wouldn't go within a hundred feet of a canyon or mountain. I damn sure wouldn't do it alone. But Ralston begins to become delusional and hallucinate about past relationship and his family members. He realizes he never appreciated life or anything in it. He does the unthinkable and amputates his harm with a dull pocket-knife.The amputation scene was not what I expected. I expected it to be extremely gory, gruesome, and disgustingly unwatchable. It was pretty graphic, but not as graphic as I had hoped. It hardly made me cringe. Still very well done effect wise, just not as good as it's hype.James Franco deserved the Best Actor Oscar most definitely. I haven't seen The King's Speech, but Collin Firth must've truly been something to beat Franco to the Oscar. He might not be Oscar material as a host, but he sure was it as an actor.Is 127 Hours an autobiography? A documentary? A drama? Or maybe a ""docudrama."" It is an up close, in your face look at fear and hopelessness, and the closest thing you will get to that painful five days. It's almost like a documentary within a drama film. Something I've rarely seen. Further shows why Boyle's 127 Hours is a masterpiece on film.Starring: James Franco. Directed by: Danny Boyle.

In Danny Boyle's ""127 Hours"", Aron Ralston becomes the embodiment of the human spirit, and we are captivated and we cheer for him, both towards the film and to the real person as well. Here is a man that is full of courage and determination to did what he had to do to survive, and that is a triumph in itself.In the film, Ralston is played by James Franco. He is the core of the entire movie, with the entire movie focused on him; not only does he physically fit the real Ralston well, he also delivers a terrific performance, that is really physically and mentally draining, both for him to deliver and for us to watch. This is Franco's best film thus far. Take for example the scenes where he interviews himself. It may be comic relief but Franco displays every emotional shade that really showcases his true, raw talent as an actor, and also engages the audience in a thrill ride, even though the film isn't an action film.But it doesn't need to be an action film. Danny Boyle, fresh from his Oscar win for ""Slumdog Millionaire"", utilizes his same kinetic and energetic direction in every shot so that Franco's vivid portrayal can shine through with the same energy as a lightning bolt, and the film's pace not feel boring throughout. The editing by Jon Harris is pitch perfect; it is vibrant without being forceful, and it is inventive with its cutting, especially during the split-screen scenes, but in some parts it gets quite distracting. Boyle employs two cinematographers for this film: his usual one Anthony Dod Mantle, and Enrique Chediak. Both make full use of the camera as they both shoot sweeping scenery of the American desert and canyons at the beginning, and then when Ralston is trapped they think of every possible angle they can place their camera on to give a sense of extreme claustrophobia and realism. The home-video feel adds more to the experience and makes the film feel as real as possible. Also from ""Slumdog"", acclaimed Indian composer A. R. Rahman returns to give an ambient and quite somber score that suits the situations perfectly.The way Boyle depicts Ralston's excruciating ordeal is raw and almost documentary-like. It's not too dark and brooding and full of hopelessness, nor is it handled in a clumsily light-hearted manner (NO ONE in their right mind will try to craft this film in the latter way). Boyle knows what he's doing. So is Franco. The way the young actor screams, the expressions he shows when he is distraught and desperate, the way the camera focuses on his face somberly as if it was his doom, it is excruciating to watch but at the same time no one can pry their eyes off the screen. At the climax of the film there is a very graphic and disturbing scene that will make the squeamish turn away, but I say it adds greatly to the film's harrowing effect.In my opinion this film deserves every single accolade it has received. This film is not only an inspiring tale that is well-crafted and extremely well-acted, it's in many ways a testament to the human spirit and it's undying determination to survive. In this world some of us may be cast aside and left unnoticed as the world keeps spinning, but let this movie be reminded that there is still hope, and it comes in strange, and sometimes unpleasant ways. Bravo to Mr. Boyle, Mr. Franco, and the crew of the film, and very especially Mr. Ralston for such a tremendous accomplishment.Another reason why Hollywood still has some juice in it.Overall rating: 89/100 ","     force  nature    powerful  anything else   world, perhaps even   universe,    human spirit -   will  survive.

It's more the sort of yarn suited to a half hour doco, seeing as the action is stuck in the one place for five days. It's a marvel then __ although not overly surprising __ that Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy, director and writer respectively of the phenomenal Slumdog Millionaire, have eked out a worthy story that capably fits the feature film format.They've developed the premise to focus more on the mentality of Ralston during his suffering. He cycled through a gamut of emotions __ regret, despair, acceptance, anger, frustration, embarrassment __ and how Boyle presents these is definitely left of centre, but all the more intriguing for it. The use of flashbacks and dream segments are often lazily used to convey a character's thoughts, although they're still a damn fine narrative tool if you use them correctly and Boyle wonderfully segues in and out of these sequences as if they were an extension of the present action.Some of Ralston's delirium-fuelled moments are cringe-worthy and humiliating, but Boyle doesn't shoot them with a rose coloured lens. What you see is an authentic depiction of how this man (re)acted to the gradual realisation these were his last days on earth. When you're on your own with no hope of surviving, why concern yourself with something trivial like how you might look if there was ever a movie made about you? Well, Ralston didn't and Boyle respected that. Subsequently we, the audience, have been privy to something we weren't supposed to see, and there is something very fascinating about that.Cillian Murphy was originally planned to play the doomed adventurer, and though I'm sure he would've been great, it's now hard to imagine anyone other than James Franco in the role. The real Ralston had never allowed anyone outside of his own family and friends to see the camcorder footage he shot over those harrowing 127 hours, until he permitted both Franco and Boyle to watch it. This private screening must've been invaluable to Franco especially; his portrayal is carefully layered and well thought out. Franco slots into the ""everyman"" mould with ease and offers a quirky side to Ralston without ever being overtly quirky. Colin Firth should win the Best Actor Oscar for The King's Speech, but Franco thoroughly deserves his nomination and I'm sure we haven't seen the last of him come future awards seasons.An ordinary man placed in an extraordinary situation is compelling viewing thanks to Boyle's masterful direction and Franco's powerful performance.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Fine, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant) "," Although undeniably amazing,  story  Aron Ralston isn't something  strikes   ripe  cinematic treatment.    sort  yarn suited   half hour doco, seeing   action  stuck   one place  five days.   marvel  __ although not overly surprising __  Danny Boyle  Simon Beaufoy, director  writer respectively   phenomenal Slumdog Millionaire,  eked   worthy story  capably fits  feature film format.They've developed  premise  focus    mentality  Ralston   suffering.  cycled   gamut  emotions __ regret, despair, acceptance, anger, frustration, embarrassment __   Boyle presents   definitely left  centre,     intriguing  .  use  flashbacks  dream segments  often lazily used  convey  character's thoughts, although  still  damn fine narrative tool   use  correctly  Boyle wonderfully segues      sequences      extension   present action.Some  Ralston's delirium-fuelled moments  cringe-worthy  humiliating,  Boyle doesn't shoot    rose coloured lens.   see   authentic depiction    man (re)acted   gradual realisation    last days  earth.       no hope  surviving,  concern   something trivial    might look    ever  movie made  ?

127 Hours,540,seaview1,25/Feb/11,8,1.4154427190306659e-09,film one not will well even films time can way life make makes may director enough still never great two see first heart world people ever big tale family human feel kind audience moving really works right moments,0.0,1.0,inf,inf,inf," Based on the harrowing tale of survival by Aron Ralston and adapted by Simon Beaufoy and director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later), 127 Hours challenges the viewer to share in a difficult, life changing event that most people could never contemplate. It's quite a feat to engage and emotionally move an audience focused solely on one person in one place. For an actor to pull this off is a great testament to James Franco's acting skills and physical prowess as well as Boyle's ingenuity behind the camera. In April, 2003, Aron Ralston (Franco) escapes the rat race of the city to go hiking in a remote terrain. After parking his car, he goes mountain biking and then by foot deeper into isolation. There, he comes upon two hikers, Megan and Kristi, who are a bit lost. He tells them that the earth with its rocks and mountains is always moving. How prophetic! Aron guides the women and puts them on the right track after a brief adventure in a cave and a sparkling pool of water. Later, he proceeds on his trek of solitude and, while climbing between a narrow ravine, slips, and as he falls, a large bolder tumbles and pins his arm against the wall. Trying everything possible to dislodge the rock, he finds he is hopelessly trapped with limited supplies. No one knows where he is because he was didn't care enough to mention it to family or friends. He is a confident, even cocky explorer whose cavalier attitude changes through this ordeal. He displays some amazing resourcefulness in such moments as when he erects a mini tent to protect his head from the elements. As he waits in vain for help that is not coming, he contemplates his survival skills and evaluates his life and relationships. Life is precious, and he must do whatever he can to survive even if it means the unthinkable. The entire film works despite the fact it centers exclusively on one actor. (The Spirit of St. Louis is another that comes to mind.) Franco accomplishes the difficult task by making us care for an arrogant, free spirit who knows no fear. The film focuses on minute details that could easily be glossed over. The simplest of acts become a tortuous struggle as when his pocket knife falls and he must retrieve it while still pinned. A drink of water from his ever shrinking supply becomes an agonizing death watch. The flashback scenes give us some background into his family life and a former girlfriend. He even fantasizes a vision of a boy, a son that he will perhaps have someday? He regrets the things left undone or unsaid and resolves to make changes in his life if he makes it out alive. The fact that we know the outcome does not at all diminish the agony we feel for him in close quarters and his determination to survive. In a way the big rock is a kind of metaphor for his life. What should be a liberating journey becomes a test of survival, and as the hours go by and one day bleeds into the next, we become a part of his limited world complete with cracks of sunlight and an occasional bird or insect. After awhile you wonder if we really see images he is seeing, or if it is nothing more than a mirage or hallucination. During his ordeal he uses his mini video camera to document his plight and to report on his situation and feelings. The camera becomes a sort of confessor for him. Yes, the scene where he must separate himself from the rock is excruciating but never exploitive. The subsequent scenes where he makes his way back to civilization and encounters other hikers are powerfully heart wrenching yet life affirming. It packs a punch and wrings you emotionally as Franco finds salvation when all hope is seemingly lost. By film's end we breathe a collective sigh of relief. Yet it is the cumulative effect of emotions and our shared experience with him that are truly affecting. Boyle utilizes hand-held cameras and crisp editing to keep things moving along in a methodically paced narrative. It is ironic at how the beautiful landscape is in sharp contrast to the horror that Aron must experience. The film may set a record for having the longest running time before displaying its first title card. There is a nice epilogue which alludes to his prophetic visions from before. This is not a morbid exercise in claustrophobia or grossness but rather a realistic recreation of the triumph of the human spirit against impossible odds and the bleakest of settings.

There shouldn't be an epic plot or dozens of well known cast in order for one to be a great one. But it's a must to be something new and should have the capacity to explore the deepest human emotions and ability to inject them directly in to the viewers blood. '127 hours' has all that packed with adrenalin gushing truly painful 94mts.The story is very simple and straight forward. Aron Ralston (Played by James Franco __ Spider Man) who is a mountain climber sets off climbing in Utah with high spirits as usual on a one fine Saturday. But he finds himself to be in a death defying situation soon after he met with an accident and trapped in between boulders with a big rock crushing his arm. Now he faces the challenge of getting out alive before he runs out of supplies and most importantly his state of mind. (This situation which immediately reminds me of the similar Discovery- I shouldn't be alive Episode 'trapped under a boulder'. Though it has some resemblance it's important to know that both of them are true life stories and very unique at some points. Recommended!)The script is so strong that it will eventually force you to experience what Aron is going though. What kind of pain he must be bearing up and what emotions, hallucinations and memories he eventually gets trapped in. And most importantly what a man will become and can become when he is faced with the greatest challenge of his life. Aron at times looses hope and record himself saying sorry and good bye to his parents on the camcorder he has but on the next moment he mutter to himself 'Do not loose it' and struggle to overcome the situation. James Franco does a breath taking job making this character plain impossible to forget. Coming from the once Oscar winning director of 'Slumdog Millionaire' Danny Boyle '127 Hours' is not at all a disappointment. Trust me it can be very hard to watch when the real ordeal roll out but if you manage to get though them with one piece of mind then I'm sure you will feel how heroic you are when everything is over. Cinematographically very challenging to pull off which mostly takes place in a very tight space with most of the close up shots, the job is well done. Time to time it gives you some space when Aron's memories comes alive and the sets take place elsewhere but you are quickly returned to the tight spot abandoning all your craziest hopes of escape. '127 hours' is not a super hero movie or even a story of a real life hero. It's a story of a person like you and me with ambitions and interests who suddenly finds himself to be in a situation where he has to make real hard decisions to live further. Once the movie finished we all feel glad that he made correct decision even how hard it maybe. And that's something for all of us to keep in mind. The most important decisions in life are not the easiest ones but they will make you live stronger afterwords. more of my reviews at flickshout.blogspot.com ","  score 4/5   good movies     great movies.  shouldn't   epic plot  dozens  well known cast  order  one    great one.    must   something new     capacity  explore  deepest human emotions  ability  inject  directly    viewers blood.

127 Hours,542,pizzazzman2000,18/Feb/11,9,2.652139085386788e-12,film movie one not well even can much make just makes work director enough still new never only see heart also without ever something big real tale years feel get audience worth moving really screen far seen right music moments plot,0.0,1.0,inf,inf,inf," Ever since we jumped onto the Boyle-Rahman bandwagon 2 years ago with Slumdog Millionaire, even back then, at least for me, it was hard to fathom the combined strength of this duo. Which brings me back to an amazing concept pointed out by Napoleon Hill called the ""mastermind group""....which literally states that the combined mind powers of a group can generate enough energy and force which is greater than the individual strengths of any single mind. And this is one work by the master duo of Boyle and Rahman which establishes a vibrant and dominant punch,just like Slumdog. The directorial ingenuity of Boyle, added to the musical grace of Rahman, throws them into the ring of other brilliant contemporary directors.A nicely directed film with a prefect plot which reverts close to the actual reality. Sure, Boyle by himself is a maestro in his entirety, and for the heck of it I'm being repetitive here, but Rahman has also always been worth more than his salt, but a killer combination or fusion of the Boyle-ian and Rahman-ian elements generated a power worth more than the common mind could fathom. As far as I was affected, I haven't come across a movie like this which not only grabs you by the throat right into its heart, but dials-up your emotions that you begin to experience something on the likes of anxiety, panic attacks, fear, and all those essential feelings which make it almost impossible for you to stick to your seats and watch with the normal relaxation you would expect. Definitely I would not recommend this movie for the weak-hearted.But how does the Boyle-Rahman formula actually come into play? Sure, we could have removed Rahman and had still a gripping tale which makes our eyes pop out when we see the challenging and grueling battle against the natural elements of isolation, heat , plus the addition of a dwindling water supply and food supply, which Aron has to play out. But the brilliance of the genius in a director combo is truly evaluated by its ability to hide your mind from the reality - the reality that this is acting and not fact. The true brilliance is felt when it draws you under its covers so much, that you begin to feel the powerful emotions which the main protagonist goes through. So much so, that the viewer is drawn into a totally new ""reality"", a reality non-existent. In other words, for those few minutes, the mind cannot even realise that none of this is real. I, for starters, during those ""gory"" moments, found myself unable to keep still, and kept moving around in my seat, wondering how anyone could actually carry that out! Of course, on closer analysis, it's evident that it's not just what is projected on the screen which triggers this adrenalin rush, and makes one register on the emotional richter scale, but also the music eclat which really helps manifest the true plight, emotions, agony, challenge, despair,faced by Aron Ralston, and even more, bring all these beyond the big screen and actually inject these feelings into us! A brilliant job by Rahman........kudos to you!All it takes is your musical genius to give this movie a white-knuckle finish and make us actually ""live"" it!A truly daedal killer scheme for direction and music.Of course, the 127 Hours effect wouldn't be complete without giving true commendation to James Franco's brilliant acting. Thorughout the film, his professional brilliance and dexterous acting never let up which themselves contribute to creating a riveting appeal for the film. This becomes particularly eminent when the climax of the film begins to surface, that is, from the moment Aron gets trapped in the canyon unable to free his arm. The novelty of the portrayal of his flashback memories becomes clear when it becomes hard to decipher exactly the points when Aron drifts from reality into flashback and back. Being part of the audience, it was very difficult for my mind to get a handle on what was reality and what was hallucination. This is the combined work of the direction and cinematography which go hand in hand to create such an effect on the mind that the line between the reality and imagination on the screen gets totally blurred!I can positively say, beyond the shadow of doubt, that Boyle and Rahman provide a holistic approach towards their own creation or rather genre which helps stir up those emotions that put our minds right in the heart of the film and make us live those powerful moments. And nice work, which has generated enough Oscar buzz that it remains to be seen how well it can compete against the other potential candidates. This is one film which speaks of novelty on all fronts - direction, cinematography, music, and last but not least, star acting!And if we thought Slumdog Millionaire was gung-ho enough, we now realise that Boyle and Rahman are crossing over towards the pinnacle of their success as a duo.

As the name suggests , 127 Hours is about Aron Ralston struggling to get out of a situation he is stuck for 127 hours. Aron is an ordinary guy working as an engineer in Intel. One fine day , he decides to get away for a weekend to Utah for mountaineering and canyoneering without letting anyone know about it. He packs up his bag with the needful items and goes for the trip on by-cycle. As a mountaineer , he goes for a hiking to various rock-stoned mountains , valleys and ridges until he loses control and falls into a pitch and boulder gets dislodged and drops on his right forearm.

127 Hours,549,Charladeeda,15/Jan/11,8,1.303426486087547e-07,film movie one not will well even can life just enough still fun never two heart also people big real doesnt character get better really cinema isnt music,0.0,1.0,inf,inf,inf," 127 is the perfect movie for someone who hasn't thought about their future or doesn't have a lot of hope in life. It's an extremely brilliant adventure that takes you to places you have never dreamt of going to. The movie is based on the book ""Between A Rock And A Hard Place"" by Aron Ralston. The book is about Ralston's life changing week with his arm stuck between a boulder and the Blue John canyon. In the movie, Ralston is played by James Franco (Spiderman, Pineapple Express), who shows such realistic and believable enthusiasm through out the whole film, he really puts his whole heart and soul into acting this role. Its an easy character to mess up, but he doesn't miss his target one single bit. The start of the movie is mainly showing you who Aron Ralston is on the inside, a bit of a stupid and big headed electritionist who doesn't answer his mom's calls and doesn't tell anyone where and what he's up to. After about five minutes of up-beat music and Ralston getting ready for a hike, the scene moves to a desert at about eight o'clock in the morning, and Aron riding a mountain bike to the mighty Blue John canyon. When arriving at the canyon, Aron runs into two girls around about his age, Christie and Megan, who are looking for a 'dome' in the location. Ralston, knowing every inch of the canyon, directs them to the 'dome' with a warm hand shake and nice big grin, he also takes them to a water hole under ground, where they all have fun diving and jumping into the gorgeous blue liquid. After about an hour, Aron leaves the two girls, who also invite him to their party the next night, and runs off to continue his hike. Soon enough, Aron comes to his famous fall and crushing experience, as he jumps off of a ledge, and brings a huge rock down the gap with him, locking his arm in an terribly painful position against the wall of the canyon and the huge chalk stone. Ralston panics but tries to hold himself together, trying to push up the rock from his arm, with no luck, he gets out everything from his ruck sack and finds a blunt pen knife which he uses to try and chip away the rock with. after a few days of recording his days and still chipping away at the rock, Aron comes to the idea of cutting of his arm, but the pen knife isn't very sharp for that sort of thing, so he gives up and ponders through other possibilities of how to get himself out of this mess. Ralston starts having visions of his past and epiphanies of how he would re-start his life if he gets the chance. He pictures his close families and friends all sitting on and around a couch, and the next vision is of a small boy, possibly being either himself at a younger age, or his future child (which Aron Ralston later has in late February 2010) but, after seeing this young boy, he realise what he has to do, he breaks both bones in his arm and well, you know the rest. After going through this whole tear-jurking struggle of keeping faith in himself Ralston starts to reconstruct his entire life, he continues to hike and climb mountains, but he ""always leaves a note, to tell people where he's going"" -this movie really is a phenomenon and a real pleasure to watch, even with a bit of gore here and there. James Franco just is Aron Ralston, i could not imagine a better actor for this part. I can gladly say its my favourite film to watch in the cinema at the moment, and i will definitely be getting it on DVD when it is released. Thank you Aron Ralston for taking us on this beautiful journey of inspiration.

The film stars James Franco as real-life adventurer Aron Ralston, who became trapped by a fallen boulder that crashed on his arm and trapped him in an isolated canyon in Blue John Canyon, Utah. The cinematography of the desert was beautiful shot. I like how Boyle convey the vastness of the canyon and the area of Aron get entombed. I was kinda one of the people that didn't really watched to see this, but after seeing the reviews. I went to see this on my own. I was pretty blown away. I kinda like James Franco in this movie, he was very charming in this movie, unlike his roles in Spiderman. It's probably his best role since Pineapple Express. It was a great start, by 20 minutes in the film, besides meeting the girls Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tambyln). You pretty much just have James Franco stuck on a rock. Most of the scenes Aron shares with them is pretty much pointless. In my opinion, you can pretty much skip 20 minutes until he get his hand stuck and you wouldn't miss much. So James Franco's Aron Ralston had to be a likable character in this for it to work. The one thing, I found funny is how loose that rock look. He pretty much, did a dumbass move, by getting stuck like that in my opinion. Anyways, days pass, and you see flashbacks from his life. The good thing about this movie is that he didn't really had a bad life, unlike most of the movie's survivor characters I watch. The film introduces us to Aron's father (Treat Williams) and mother (Kate Burton) and the love of his life, Rana (Clemence Poesy) through brief flashback. These moments, though brief, helps to give us insight into Aron's character and life. At times it was hard to know what the flashbacks were referring to. I recommend reading the book or getting the book on tape to get a great account if the story first, before watching this. His mind is running, while he is not. It was just him, trying to get away from the pain of being trapped. He gets crazy, and acts funny at times without moving. I love the idea of him trying to keep sane, by acting like he has a TV Show at the abandoned canyon. I like how strong and smart, he can be, despite being a bit of an idiot. There is no force more powerful than the will to live. I love the Gatorade scene as well. I never though Scooby Doo can be use so creepy. The dream sequences are very haunting and well done. Without spoiling the ending, there is a scene where Aron must act upon to save himself. That scene is both realistic and gruesome, even more when one takes into account that this actually occurred. Rarely does a scene make me wince and recoil the way this scene did. It's brilliantly shot, edited, and executed; graphic, but Boyle only shows as much as necessary relying on haunting sound effects and Franco to convey what's happening. It's a powerful, unforgettable scene. It's a bit predictable, if you saw the trailers for the film or hear the movie. Most people know what happens to Aron Ralston, there. It can be a bit long, and drawn out. It would probably work better as a good documentary with scenes of Aron's family talking about him with the movie style reenactment. Still, I like the movie to have more description of Aron's efforts trying to get out of the desert. Overall, I like the movie. It's an inspiring tale of the strength of the human spirit. So check it out, and see how one man cheated death.

Boyle needn't have worried; heading a team drawn from his earlier productions, he delivers a punchy, convincing and watchable piece of work. (Rodrigo Cort Ãs got there last year with Buried, a taphephobic thriller trapping Ryan Reynolds in an underground box. And film purists will say Hitchcock did it with Rear Window.) Fortunately, cinematography and sound design help to create enough variety around likable protagonist James Franco for the movie not to seem like being trapped in a canyon for 127 hours.Adapted from Between a Rock and a Hard Place __ a memoir by Aron Ralston __ the film concerns the five-day period when, following a freak accident, a young climber's right hand was pinned by a falling boulder. Since no one knew of Ralston's whereabouts, starvation and dehydration loomed even though the pain of the injury had subsided. In print, Ralston's involuntarily immobility is an opportunity to reflect on his past life and mistakes; the movie uses condensed flashbacks, which mean Ralston's personal reflections seldom displace the more practical issue of survival. Despite these differences, book and film alike act as unwitting barometers of certain changes in society's values.The opening images reveal huge crowds on the move, combining what could be footage left over from Slumdog Millionaire with a basketball game at Utah Jazz's EnergySolutions Arena. Quite deliberately, this creates a contrast between the heaving multitudes of modern life and the solitary virtues of the wilderness. By showing rather than telling, Boyle lets us work this out by ourselves __ which comes as a relief, compared to equivalent passages in Ralston's autobiography. In both film and book, the central narrative __ trapped man has to go to extremes to escape __ grabs the imagination.Ralston's memoir shows him embracing the outdoor life and abandoning a conventional career. Trained as an engineer, he focuses on the weekend __ athletically hiking and attacking canyons and mountains with vigour __ until the weekend's activities take priority completely. Eventually Ralston downsizes to working in a climbing gear shop and as a rescue volunteer because that is what he wants to do: 'because it's there' is the rationale for his outdoor activities. 'Climbing fourteeners in the winter by myself wasn't just something I did; it became who I was', he writes.Ralston writes of human estrangement from nature, all the while revealing his estrangement from other humans. For Boyle, there's no need to spell this out as ploddingly as the book does; instead it is implied, by cutting back and forth between beautiful landscapes and Ralston's claustrophobic surroundings, or between a crowded screen and the isolated figure cut by Franco throughout his restrained performance. The protagonist's estrangement from friends and relatives ends up played out into a half-hallucinated domestic world in which the dying Ralston makes (and videotapes) his apologies. Boyle has been accused of misanthropy before, as in his pseudo-zombie fest 28 Days Later, but here the disdain for humans seems to be more Ralston's message, whose ordeal could be seen as a realistic personal apocalypse.It is no spoiler to say that Ralston escaped by cutting off his right forearm. Indeed, among various commentators the shorthand __ no pun intended __ is to call this 'the amputation scene'. 'If you don't mind, I'm going before the arm', one squeamish critic told the receptionist at the press screening I attended. Those who stuck around witnessed a realistic looking scene where mobility is regained by hacking through flesh with a blunt multi-tool __ one of those steel knocks-off of the Leatherman multiknife, handed out as freebies at petrol stations. Not only are they useless for chipping away at boulders, but, as audiences will see, they are also completely unsuitable as surgical instruments. Given the annual popularity of the Saw franchise, it is not impossible that this gruesome 'money shot' will be one of the things bringing people into the multiplexes and scooping up the pirate DVD in pubs, especially since improvements in prosthetics and digital effects are such that surgical scenes have acquired greater verisimilitude in the past decade.More seriously, the film has the universal appeal of making one ask 'what would I do in that situation?

He as an actor not only delivers a realistic performance, but as the story continues he delves deep into the character, and brings this fascinating story to life on the big screen. As an audience you feel the pain and frustration Aron does. You sympathise with the character easily, as he struggles to gain control of the situation he has found himself in. James Franco should be highly commended for captivating an audience for an entire film, which can be described as a one man show. It's only at the very beginning and end of the narrative that you see him truly engage with any other characters. I would describe Franco's performance as flawless. Trapped by a boulder, his performance relies in that of his facial expressions. His expressions change so easily, he goes from desperation to comedy to a primitive will to survive in an instant.What also makes this film so successful, is the fact that it is done in the hands of Danny Boyle, a highly commendable director. Boyle's direction is energetic and exciting. Even when the film becomes grounded in the narrow canyon where Aron is trapped, Boyle still manages to keep things interesting. Boyle and his co-writers introduce flashbacks and hallucinations, which bring heart-breaking effects. Included is the premonition that drives Aron into finally amputating his arm.What I was also impressed by in this film was the cinematography which was used. The landscape in itself was breathtaking and the camera angles used show just how vast the canyon is. Then when you get to the confined space when Aron is trapped, they use every camera angle possible, often bringing the audience very close to the action.At the end of the day many people may see this as a film about a mountain climber who gets stuck under a boulder and has to cut his arm off, but it is so much more than that. It personifies a man overcoming physical and emotional strains of an extraordinary situation. Above all it can be seen as a celebration of the human spirit and their will to live. The composition between dark humour, vast and confined spaces, varied editing techniques and Franco's diverse use of facial expressions, make for a well executed piece of filmmaking. Even though as an audience you know how its going to end, it is still very captivating right from the start.

The good side is that it enhances the 'it could happen to you' feeling while you're watching. The bad side is that most viewers will already know the ending before they start watching.Nevertheless, this turns out to be a great and gripping movie, even if I did know what happened beforehand. Danny Boyle, who I haven't always liked in the past (I hate TRAINSPOTTING with a vengeance), manages to keep the film pacey and engaging despite not much happening for the duration. He uses frenetic camera-work, flashbacks, monologues and snapshots of the beautiful, arid locales to great effect.This is a film that emphasises realism above all else, and again, there are good and bad sides to that. James Franco (delivering a solid performance) plays a guy who isn't exactly likable or sympathetic, yet that serves to make the tale that unfolds all the more believable. Yes, 127 HOURS contains one of the most excruciating sequences ever put on film, but it's not really about the visceral side of the experience: it's instead a great psychological study of the human mind put in a situation with seemingly no way out.

He's made movies that were valuable to my collection, but he never seemed to give me any emotional resonance or even that much extensive thought after his movies were over; you hit play and then subsequently when it's over you press off and don't even have a second's thought.Here, I rented this with not a lot of tentativeness, even though I wasn't a disciple of Boyle beforehand; but James Franco gave a better than expected performance (I have to admit from ""Milk"" (2008) he never really impressed me and I didn't really have any empathy for him; I found him dull and one dimensional; that's not saying he didn't do well, but he didn't do AS well as I would have thought).The movie is on a true story, and I was then hooked to the idea of watching it; the beginning is already giving you catalysts of the need for water; it was moderately interesting how the three sights on screen were sometimes edited together in a sinew of images, like Franco (Aron Ralsto in the movie) going past a McDonalds joint and drinking on the way; initially, you notice a tap dripping, dripping and dripping... the only place left where he could fetch water.However, he still has the teenager and reckless life style, and yet is still extremely lively as a human being. He meets these two girls, and he shows them the sites of Utah.Boyles' cinematographer gives the landscape great width, predictably and uninhibited crane moves into the field of it; however, it does not add much to the story, but it is still immensely enticing to gaze at. We get a full glance at the area that Aron climbs regularly.And of course, Franco falls into the cave, and his hand is stuck underneath a rock; I would have thought that the whole thing would be boring after that, and then I was immersed into the common, yet fascinating back story of his life, and how he copes in the whereabouts with such little advantage; it grinds on the visceral and nostalgic and hopeful future that compels one man without any help to go way and beyond. It does have some shocking bits, but all in all, it can be dampened with the chopping and pretenses that he is about to do it, and then stopping. Also, I feel it is heavily inspired by Aronofsky's editing style, where the water is involved (the only thing he can drink) and then it may shoot a trivial and important thing at the same time, like the juice from his car. However, my favorite bits were definitely when he exchanged his sorrows so that he could replenish his hope, like telling his Mum he's sorry he didn't answer her or how he was unable to attend her Sister's Wedding and so on; he does this in a humorous and moving way. I also love how his camera is constantly being used; however that was rather mind boggling because you're wondering ""Why is this guy using his camera within such a limited time of survival?""... at least he wanted to document his last times, but he doesn't even take the camera with him when he escapes... However, the camera is there for his comfort as well; it's his only tool that could have been his last means of communication - there was also a scene where his face is in three frames concurrently through the camera, however this is not important.The charm to it is that everything he sees and feels in his state becomes his only instinct - he yearns for the open area just like any man would and yet he does it with some pretty savage consequences. The movie even beguiles you at one point with how he gets out in a sequence! It is important to note that the story doesn't have a moral and in fact the ending is possibly not going to gel with everyone and that was it really.So my last thoughts on the movie are that Boyle has set up a surface and a peregrination for the viewer; he may then take it away for the character to be developed but I am certain that the most powerful elements are definitely the cautionary thought and careful consideration of one man forsaken and then impelled to the edge. The movie does run its course eventually, though, but it's safe to say the scene where he saves himself was worth the wait in the way it was shot with sufficiently mind altering effects... we are then free and so is he! That's the brilliant thing about the movie despite minor flaws with its timing and the characters bold and unidentifiable way... and then you see him develop and you're moved by it.

He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 2005 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for The Da Vinci Code.) What Franco does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Franco is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at this time.But Franco is not alone. Treat Williams plays the father's hero of the story, Aron's Dad, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Treat has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in Crash Point Zero (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the boulder that crushes his upper limbs whilst canyoneering alone, played perfectly by a Styrofoam rock, we have a doozy. I want to tell you this rock is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his it's character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory behavior. You will take delight, I promise.127 Hours also sees director Boyle at his very best. Boyle has a lot in common with an ace director of the previous generation, the consistently brilliant William Wyler, especially in his approach to actors. Like Wyler, Boyle fully understands that an acting performance is comprised of many facets __ voice, facial expression, body language, distance from the audience __ and a director can choose which to show and which not to show, to varying effect. Take that masterful opening shot __ we are introduced to the eponymous 127 Hours in a slow zoom out, gradually revealing the bulky cluster of minerals dominating the foreground, his back to the audience. This establishes the scene as an intimidating presence __ no face to be seen as yet. When we do see Aron the dimness of the exterior makes his stern expression all the more formidable for how hard it is to read. Even when we see him in brighter surroundings with the other back packers it is from an objectively distant crane shot. It is only later in the picture that he becomes human to us, and we get to see a little true emotion and softness in his face.Which of course brings us round to the sterling work of James Franco. The really great ones kind of submerge themselves. I always say that Franco is like Brando, and I've always thought that she had that incredible sort of internal ability to submerge into the role and be lost in it in a good way. You know, so I see that with the best actors, DeNiro's like that, so many good actors are like that.I have from the second I saw him in the Spiderman films. I just thought this kid has something different. He just has something different.He just has insight, that unique insight that certain people have. You're not getting a cookie cutter performance. You're getting something that you don't expect. You don't know where to go and you kind of take the ride. He has the potential to be one of the best of her generation if not the best. Sean Bott in particular has this brilliantly passive, steely air about him, and the dispassionate way he does everything is a sublime bit of understatement.When it comes to the Oscars, 127 Hours will most certainly scoop Best Picture, it is a real prize for the industry, proving at last that Hollywood is back on top.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #1 at the IMDb.

Once again, he has kept up the flawless work with his latest film, 127 Hours (2010). James Franco gives an absolutely outstanding performance in this true story about a mountain climber, Aron Ralston, who becomes trapped inside a canyon when a boulder falls onto his arm. From here, we stick with Aron as he tackles the struggle of survival for the next 127 hours (We can thank elliptical editing for only having to sit through 94 minutes of this brutal attack by nature). To say it is a story of survival would be an understatement. It's a story of what it means to live__why we do the things we do, what's important, what isn't. It's about human will power, but Aron Ralston did not just suffer 127 hours of physical pain. This film takes us on an existential journey in discovering what his life truly meant to him. Despite the pain and suffering Aron must manage, we get to admire the beautiful cinematography. It's pretty safe to say that in the wrong hands, this film could have been a major let down__a lifetime movie, perhaps? Luckily, the visual imagery by cinematographers Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle will capture your attention and hold it for the length of the film. Their collaboration successfully captures the landscape's harsh beauty. The visual style most definitely supports the story telling. Aron may be pinned into immobile suffering, but the camera sure isn't. The constant movement works omnisciently, allowing us to understand every aspect of Aron's entrapment within the canyon and his conscience.

Hours depicts the true story of 28 year old Aaron Ralston, played by now Oscar nominated actor James Franco, who for 127 antagonizing and haunting hours in a mountain crevice in Utah, encounters the survival with one arm impractical to use and with both little food or water after a sudden accident leaving him vulnerable and alone. Hours is also, for me, one of the best movies of last year due to a powerful duo of great acting and directing. Much acclaim has gone into Hours since its initial release back in November. First off, I agree with critics in saying that actor James Franco (Spiderman 1-3, Pineapple Express) was fantastic as Ralston, showing a more human side to his character as a person who feels alone to be out in the world around him. He regularly avoids his family, has little to no friends outside classmates from school, and was always considered a loner to everyone he encountered. He pulls this off perfectly in a few crucial scenes in the movie. The decomposition of Ralston's character is unmatched to any performance that I've seen all year, which is why I'm personally rooting for Franco to win the Oscar.British director Danny Boyle(Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later) is the driving force for 127 Hours to not only be critically acclaimed (garnering 6 Oscar nominations for the upcoming Oscars in February), but to be both spiritually and emotionally driven with its 94 minute runtime. His fluid direction filled with beautiful cinematography of the landscapes of the Utah desert, stylized editing skills that show off how visionary Boyle is in storytelling (through flashbacks of Ralston's own life and vision of things to come in his changed life), and with his great collaboration with composer A.R Rahman (up for a Oscar nomination himself), giving Hours a great depth to be seen multiple times outside one viewing. Hours shows a side to a human character that can overcome the even most impossible scenario in a life or death situation, shows why I loved 127 Hours so much. The limited use of live outside shots to help establish an atmosphere so cluster phobic and grisly that you feel that, with Aaron, we too have an boulder imprinted into our own arm. We may not see it or feel the same way Ralston/Franco felt in both real life and in the making of the film, but the rock holding us down can also reflect struggles in our own lives. Even after losing the arm he would eventually cut off himself in the process of being stuck, Ralston (like ourselves) will also change the way we see things and tend to appreciate the things around us more than we ever did. I also must add that with also being Oscar nominated for the first time, James Franco is also hosting the 83rd Academy Awards with co-host Anne Hathaway (recently named the future Cat-women for The Dark Knight Rises). I really hope the best for him, as he always seemed to be an actor I regularly disliked watching a movie where he was in it. Here, it completely does a 180 with having some of the most heartbreaking moments captured on film from 2010 alone. His composure, his positivity, and his endurance were the reasons why Ralston was able to get out of the crevice in the first place. And if Franco does turn out the victory, he would be the first ever host of the Oscars to win an award that same night as a nominee in a category. My best of wishes to Franco (and to Boyle), as you two gentlemen, performed phenomenally in Hours. The final minutes of 127 Hours may be hard to watch for some viewers (myself included), as it's a test of pure motivation and mind-set of going through the act of survival. We are prepared to go through the fate Ralston had contemplated with his character the entire film from the first minute he landed in the situation at hand. Ralston is as relatable in his own situation as this ""average-Joe"" that we notably root for, even when he shows shades of cracking at any moment. It's in this trust we give to both Franco and Boyle in delivering us an unforgettable film for us to view and talk about in years to come. Even after all is said and done (and a lot is done), Hours lingers in our minds like the rock that still lingers with Ralston's being today: horrible in the way of taking something away, but relieving in how it gave so much good back.

He made the excellent Scottish anti-drug import ""Trainspotting"" in 1996 (my personal favorite film of his so far) before re-inventing the zombie sub-genre of horror with ""28 Days Later..."" (2002) and hitting a Hollywood home-run with ""Slumdog Millionaire"" in 2008. He returns to the big screen triumphant with ""127 Hours."" The film was also produced by Christian Colson, who won the Oscar for ""Slumdog"" and was also behind the production of my favorite horror film of the new millennium so far, ""The Descent"" (2005).""127 Hours"" is based on the true story of Aron Ralston (James Franco) - based on Ralston's autobiography ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" - an avid and passionate rock climber/outdoors-man whose will and determination to survive is tested when he becomes trapped under a boulder for five days during the summer of 2003 and the film charts his initial horror at his circumstances, his repeated failures at trying to free himself, his attempts to survive in the harsh Utah desert with dwindling food and water, his desperation, his acceptance and denial of his presumed fate, and the ultimate sacrifice he makes in order to free himself from his confines at all costs and then finally make it back to civilization all right to tell his tale.What makes this film so spectacular is the amazing performance of James Franco in the lead as Aron Ralston. For a good chunk of this film's 94-minute running time, it's the James Franco show live & uncut (even though Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara drop in early on as two female hikers named Megan and Kristi, respectively, whom he accompanies briefly); we saw something similar to this when Tom Hanks was trapped alone on a desert island in the Pacific by a plane crash 11 years ago in ""Cast Away"" (2000). Ralston's ordeal, his experiences, his memories, his hallucinations, his premonitions, his suffering - everything that he feels here, we feel as audience members. In that cramped little space with Ralston, his suffering becomes our suffering to bear witness to. With dry humor, daring athleticism and unmistakable acting skill, this is probably James Franco's career performance - after his superb work as Harry Osborn in the ""Spider-Man"" movies.A lesser film would have dragged under the singular location and the fact that we're often staring directly into Franco's face most of the time. But his performance here is what keeps this film alive and moving, and dryly humorous. I'm glad Boyle's initial pick of Cillian Murphy (his alumni from ""28 Days Later..."") as Aron Ralston ultimately failed to pan out the way he wanted it to. If it did, I doubt we would have been able to see how truly amazing a performer Franco was in this film.It's clear from the very start that Ralston has a love and a passion for living life to its fullest, love and passion for the outdoors and extreme sports, and not having any regrets about any of it. But it also shows that he is somewhat vain and arrogant; we also see that he is somewhat selfish and solitary and unappreciative of some of the things he has in his life, like his parents, his friends, and his ex-girlfriend. Because of his apparent denial of the importance of such simple but essential things to his daily existence, his arrogance at failing to even tell anyone about what he was doing or where he was going is probably what ultimately leads to his 127-Hour predicament here.And he even speculates throughout the film that perhaps his life has led up to this moment, that from his childhood up until now, events have slowly built up to him being pinned under a massive boulder and questioning about whether or not he has the will to survive or die out here all alone in this canyon, with only those two women played by Tamblyn and Mara as probably the last people he will ever meet during his final moments on Earth. Danny Boyle makes great use of the outdoors location and the unusual but creative use of cinematography and camera-work: it's interesting to note the juxtaposition between the vast expanse of Utah desert in the early scenes and the confined canyon later on in the film that Ralston was initially prepared to call his tomb.""127 Hours"" is not a 94-minute preach-fest about valuing your life and living life to its fullest, and one man's ultimate struggle to survive under extreme conditions. It's also not overly melodramatic in its bold dramatization of Ralston's harrowing true-life experiences. Those who have read about what actually happened to him back in 2003 in that Utah canyon undoubtedly know the story by now and the much-talked-about sequences later on in the film about how he ultimately freed himself that have reportedly led to audience members passing out at the shock of the extreme measures he takes to triumphantly regain his freedom.Danny Boyle doesn't deny any of this to the viewer and it wouldn't seem right to do so if he did. As stated earlier, the point of this movie is to plunge the audience into Aron Ralston's true-life experiences back in 2003, to make his story more widely known, and to remind viewers that it's always a good idea to leave a note about where you're going and what you're going to be doing.10/10P.S.: The rousing score by A.R.

Similar to Cast Away, the film really does focus on the lead character, played by James Franco who is brilliant and deserved his Oscar nomination. He encapsulates the adrenaline fueled explorer perfectly where no mountain is too high for him and more importantly you like him. Its easy to sympathise with someone in the position that he finds himself in but his personality adds something to the film.What also makes the film stand-out is the cinematography and editing that can really pump up the tension.

It's a riveting experience, elevating to the extreme the notions of determination and resistance. It's a thriller, a character study, and a powerful story of courage and perseverance, even more inspiring because it's true.Despite its fairly short length, the film feels longer than that, and this is one of its main strengths. Danny Boyle's scrupulous directing creates an exhausting empathy towards Aron Ralston, the protagonist, portrayed by James Franco, in what I consider the best male performance of 2010. Empathy to the extreme as you feel like your own arm is trapped under that boulder. Free enough to move your body, having a deceptive impression of freedom, but still trapped. And when the boulder crashes on Aron's arm, his mind is clear despite the pain and so is his spirit. His self-preservation encourages him to move the boulder and never the amputation comes to his mind as an option. And, we can't imagine this cool and good looking guy will condemn himself to such a handicap. But this is because the point is still not survival. Just give him some time __ and time is all we have. ""127 Hours"" is like a prison movie with a rock as a prison cell and a Utah canyon as a jail, in the middle of nowhere. And Aron Ralston, the loner, the young free spirited climber as the prisoner, condemned to 127 hours of painful endurance, both moral and physical.I said ""loner"" but in fact, Aron is not alone, there's one second major character in this movie, inanimate but significant: the handy cam. The handy cam adds to the realism of the story, it's like the real cam of the film, not James Franco playing Aron Ralston, but Aron Ralston filming himself. Secondly, the cam is a way to convey a message that might as well be posthumous, it's his testimony. And last but not least, it plays the same role as Wilson the volleyball as the last sacred link with the rest of the world. It makes him talk, see himself like in a mirror, feeling he exists. The cam works even when it doesn't, and this is one of the most clever points of the films. We all have this strange confused feeling that we're being watched, and I don't mean paranoia. I mean when you feel you're a part of a film with an audience, you ask yourself ""what if I was watched?"" and try to act as normally as possible. The movie intelligently illustrated that feeling which, as ludicrous as it may sound, is important because preventing you from insanity by trying to maintain your reason and common sense. When Aron was hallucinating, or starting to flirt with some early steps of insanity, all his memories came to life. When he was about to please his sexual organ while watching the image of a woman's breasts, he automatically restrained himself, maintaining a form of dignity as if his family or friends were really watching.Never losing it __ this is Aron's physical and spiritual struggle, if his mind cracks up, if he breaks down under the pressure, his body is lost. And the body must be preserved, through an efficient symbiosis, to keep the spirit sane. Aron must drink even if it's pee while fantasizing about a fresh orange juice. And this is the point of the editing, one of the film other strengths : ""127 Hours"" is punctuated with entertaining montages featuring what happens inside Aron's body, when he drinks, the bubbles are like a refreshing injection of life in a suffering body, so when the water is going low __ we experience the dryness in our throats. These montages work as incredible exercises of contrasts, insisting on the location, through an extraordinary cinematography that eliminates any chance of being saved by other people. Indeed, as it goes on, as we see Aron's face getting paler and thinner, while the ""others"" are probably having fresh beers, fun and sex. We get deeper in the concept of loneliness, Aron got on this .... alone, and alone, he'll go through it.And this last point leads to one hell of a disturbing climax I won't even try to describe how graphic it is. But as shocked as I was, I couldn't help but cheer for the blood splattering, the bone snapping, every grunt, every shout, every tear, every move, because each one was like a victory against the adversity of an undeserved punishment. And this is why the movie is not just thrilling and entertaining, it's inspiring on a deeper level because it made me think that if I was in this case, I would have probably considered that removing this very arm that helps me to write these words, as a victory. This movie not only works in an emotional and physical level, engaging all your senses, it's also one of the most endearingly spiritual achievements of these last years. It's a redemption story of a character, guilty of a free-spirited nature that detached him from sacred bonds like Family, friends __ Aron's deliberate carelessness was his flaw, the one that made a simple ""oops"" omission : not telling where he was going, a fatal mistake, turning the prophecy of his ex-girlfriend :""You're gonna get so lonely"" into a reality. This experience was Aron's redemption.""127 Hours"" is about destiny, as I said sometimes we feel like we're watched, like living a film written by God where every fate is like a life-changing plot device. In Aron's case, reality exceeded the fiction, and Danny Boyle managed to create a powerful story about a new inspiring cinematic hero who tasted one of the most painful meanings of the word ""lonely"", the 127 hours in hell was his lesson, and our inspiration.

Or at least in my opinion. Alright, now let's move on.127 Hours is the story of a man named Aron who lives without limits. He goes hiking one day without a cellphone (horrible idea), and meets two girls that take a liking to him. He helps them get to where they need to go, and continues on his own little adventure. Unfortunately, all the fun ends when he slips, falling down into a hole with his arm buried under a boulder. The film stars James Franco as Aron, and his acting was phenomenal. He deserves the Oscar for this. The things I loved about him in this film are his emotions. The moment he is struck by the boulder, he isn't he isn't screaming, and he isn't really feeling the pain. He is just plain shocked. His eyes are wide open, and not a breath is coming out of him.The movie has an amazing effect on the viewer. It really makes you realize that if life knocks you down, you can still get up with a fight. It has a huge effect, considering it's a true story.Aron begins drinking his own urine, poking at the rock with a weak knife, and doing whatever else it takes to survive in the grimmest of times. Eventually, he begins hallucinating, and these hallucinations begin to fix him as a person. He feels the regret of never loving his mother or his girlfriend enough. It is very emotional and heartbreaking to watch.Now for the cons of the movie. The movie has no real critical cons, but there is a huge reason as to why some people shouldn't watch this movie. Without spoiling anything, there is a very graphic and gory scene involving the destruction of vital body parts such as nerves and ligaments. It is very graphic and very intense, and one who is uncomfortable with blood and gore may want to skip this movie. Fortunately, it really isn't to much that covering your ears and closing your eyes can't fix.Overall, this movie gets ten stars. It effected me emotionally, and believe it or not, physically as well. The severe need of water that Aron had rubbed on me, and I had to go back to refill my drink. I have never been effected by a movie like that, and it was kind of amazing. I can't imagine going into that movie without a beverage. Now that's good directing! ","  gonna start big   review  saying     BEST MOVIE   YEAR.   least   opinion.

I'll admit, I wasn't very happy to go see it, but I'm an Oscar-fan-boy, so I had to go before the ""big night"".It delivered in every possible way.If you live under a rock, 127 Hours is a movie about a man who is in the exact same position. An arrogant hiker falls into a cliff with a boulder landing on his right arm and gets stuck. It's not really a typical storyline for the big screen, but they've pulled it off.First of all, let me tell you about Danny Boyle. I'm not a very big fan of this Britih director. Slumdog Millionaire remains one of my most hated movies and The Beach wasn't a masterpiece either. In 127 Hours however, the man shows all of his skills. Split screen, wide shots, flashbacks; the lot. He, in combination with his cinematographers Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle, created an interesting contrast. The cliff looks extremely small and claustrophobic, while the flashback-shots look wide and open. Even when their shot inside a car.It is however, the movie of James Franco. He is no less then epic in this movie, creating an arrogant chap who becomes more and more self-conscious during his time under the boulder. His great performance tops during the scene where he acts like he is interviewing himself. In that scene, his optimistic arrogant self turns into a scared and exhausted man in such a gripping way, you know only a truly great actor could pull this off. Franco is that great an actor.And then ""the scene"". The amputations scene has had quite some attention. It had people vomiting, stroking and fainting and I have to say, some visitors leaved the room just before ""the scene"" was due to begin. I was seriously nervous about it too, having a thick stomach, but not the most blood-proof eyes. I'm glad I've seen it though. The amputation is as gruesome as you'd expect. As explicit as you may not have wanted, but as great as you'd wish. The intense and loud music, the amazing, not to say epic, editing combined with the journey you've been pulled into the hour before, makes this scene one of the best, intense and quite simply epic apotheoses ever in cinema.It's a masterpiece. It's not about an amputation, but about the journey that makes him do it.

I had high expectations going into 127 Hours. Well simply put, Boyle has exceeded every expectation I had. 127 Hours is by no means a movie for everyone. There is very little dialogue, it kind of reminded me of Cast Away with Tom Hanks. Different circumstances but the need to do anything(and I mean anything!) to survive is present in both films. If you like only movies with explosions or crude jokes this might not be for you. If you want to challenge yourself for 95 minutes then I highly recommend you watch 127 Hours.James Franco is nothing short of brilliant in this role that I hope lands him the Oscar. He truly put his heart and soul into this role. He is an actor on the rise and this role proves it. I really though he was great in Pineapple Express but this role puts him at the top of today's current actors.And of course with any Danny Boyle movie there is the music. I won't give anything away but the final scene in this movie along with the music brought tears in my eyes. It is truly inspirational and something I likely will never forget. In my opinion it ranks as one of greatest 5 minutes to ever end a movie. This movie serves as a metaphor to the challenges we face in life. Stuck, feeling unable to move, we must remember that if we believe and persevere we can accomplish anything life throws at us.

This is what 127 hours is about. It is a survival tale of a man trapped in an isolated canyon in Utah when a rock fell and crushed his arm against the boulder walls and who ultimately made it out 6 days later with sheer determination. 127 hours marks another remarkable feat by Academy Award Winner director Danny Boyle, best known for his 2008 critically acclaimed heavyweight Slumdog Millionaire.The film takes off at a dizzying fast pace with random montages of spectators in large sporting events, people hustling and bustling in their lives, leaky faucets, the film's protagonist Aron Ralston (played to pitch perfection by James Franco) packing in a haste and others in a split screen which initially struck out as erratic but are anything but random as they fall into pieces towards the end. The film wastes no time in diving straight to the plot as twenty minutes into the movie, the action begins when paradoxically Aron becomes entrapped.The next 127 hours (remaining 74 minutes of screen time) chronicles his deteriorating physical conditions and psyche ranging from denial (this is insane), frustration, longing, acceptance and finally the surge of willpower after having a premonition which prompted him to make the hardest decision he's ever made that led to his survival. Like any good piece of cinematic art, the performance of the actors are central to the integrity of the film. And here, James Franco delivers the most riveting performance of his career that solidified him as an immensely talented and serious actor in Hollywood. The film is essentially a one man show with the supporting cast appearing in early parts of the movie and in his flashbacks but we never get bored with Franco. Every facial expression showed his defeat and waning exhaustion with genuine emotions while his resourcefulness and self parodying moments are huge likability factors. However, it is his epiphanies through the life and death situation in which he came to recall what is important in his life that truly made a connection.The clever uses of Boyle's signature psychedelic flashbacks and hallucinations are brilliantly interwoven into and seamlessly edited in the film which provided an in-depth character development as well as heightened our senses on Aron's desires. The multiple camera angles are explored and utilized in every possible way to fully capture Aron's predicament yet not make the audience feel claustrophobic although shot in a very narrow and contained space. The cinematography is visually stunning as we get landscape and aerial views of the canyons in its full glory. Its amazing how nature can make us feel so miniscule while we enthrall in its beauty. The CGI effects are outstanding at the torrential storm scene but most importantly, the epic score by A.R Rahman stole the show for me. The dark and urgent pounding of tribal beats and the pull of a string instrument when Aron struck a nerve (literally) is most effective but it is the spiritually uplifting music at the end of the movie when Aron is rescued that conveys the gratuitous feelings of being alive in all of us.127 hours is extremely emotional, captivating, spectacular, stylistic and story telling at its best. It is a not to be missed movie of the year that stands out above the rest and is in a class of its own.

Well I'm jumping on the American critic bandwagon and I'm also saying that 127 Hours has been noted as a film of the year contender! So early you say, well watch it first and you'll see what I'm talking about! It's not just about a man's terrible accident and the situation he finds himself in. No, it's way more than that! I found myself emotionally invested in the film. I experienced a roller-coaster of emotions whilst watching this. Imagine being trapped in a canyon unable to move because your arm is stuck. Then having to make the life or death choice to remove that arm so you can be free. I have a new found respect for James Franco! The man has come a long since playing James Dean and Harry Osborn from the Spiderman movies. He was absolutely brilliant in this! He's brilliant in every scene! Utterly believable as Aron Rolston! There's a scene where Franco's character video tapes a goodbye message to his folks and thanks them for all the years they spent together as a family. A really touching scene!Throughout the film we experience his dreams, his past experiences, his nightmares and his hallucinations. It's all part of the journey we are taken on, because of this unfortunate accident. The last 10 mins are the most intense! But at the end you'll either cry, cheer, laugh or smile. That's if you haven't fainted after or during the infamous arm cutting scene. As for Danny Boyle, I honestly say he's out done himself here. If I'm being honest, I hated Slumdog Millionaire! And it should never have garnered the praise it did. But this is truly a wonderful film and his careful eye for visuals and ear for sound really make this a memorable movie going experience. The soundtrack! The soundtrack by A. R. Rahman is awesome! Expect 127 hours to be nominated for a number of awards this year. Best Actor, Director, Original Soundtrack and Best Film.

Like 'BURIED' from earlier this year this film tells the story of one man trapped in a single confined location for the duration of almost the entire film. Unlike 'BURIED' this film sets up the scenario and also leaves the primary location in flashbacks and day dreams. It also utilizes a lot of flashy special effects and stylized visuals to drive it's message home. It's still an astonishingly creative and one of a kind film going experience. It's impressively directed by Danny Boyle (in his long awaited follow-up to the Academy Award winning 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE') and features one of the best performances of the year (right alongside Ryan Reynolds in 'BURIED' in my opinion) from early Oscar front-runner James Franco.The film is written by Boyle and his 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE' scriptwriter Simon Beaufoy. It's based on an autobiographical book by Aron Ralston (entitled ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place""). The book tells of Ralston's world famous mountain climbing adventure where he became trapped by a collapsed boulder, which pinned his arm, while climbing alone in an isolated canyon in Utah in 2003. Ralston was trapped for over 5 days and finally grew up enough courage to resort to desperate measures in order to free himself and survive. Franco gives probably his finest performance to date playing the man as he struggles with survival, losing his sanity and facing his biggest regrets in life. The real Aron Ralston kept a video diary while he was stuck, as depicted in the film (using the same exact camera). He had only allowed his family and friends to view the video until he let Boyle and Franco see the footage in order to more accurately depict true events. It's been quoted that Ralston is quite happy with and moved by the film.The film is of course very moving and inspirational (at times even tear jerking) but this is something that any competent filmmaker should have been able to deliver given the material and resources. How Boyle tells the story is what's truly remarkable and memorable about the film as well as his ability to stretch the material into a highly involving and entertaining adventure for a full 93 minutes (credit also has to be given to his co-scriptwriter for that though). The movie is very claustrophobic, surreal and horrifying. The climax is excruciatingly hard to watch and more grotesque than almost any horror film (there have been reports of viewers suffering from shock and needing medical assistance at multiple screenings). James Franco is one of those actors that I never thought had much talent early on given a lot of the choices in film roles he'd take but it appears as though he just made a lot of unwise career decisions (I always thought he was the weakest link in the 'SPIDER-MAN' films). In recent years he's proved himself to be one of the most talented and diverse young actors working today. 'PINEAPPLE EXPRESS' was his initial role that really caught my attention (but I also hadn't seen his earlier memorable work on 'FREAKS AND GEEKS' until after that). This is his finest performance to date and one of the best single performances of the year and the movie is one of the most impressive creative achievements of the year as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JQ4A-I9-JM "," '127 HOURS': Four   Half Stars (  Five)   remarkably bold achievement  seemingly impossible cinematic storytelling  year!

With no means of communicating with the outside world and no hope of rescue (his decision to avoid discussing his travel planes with friends and family wasn't a brilliant move), Aron must find a way to escape his predicament while contemplating the events in his life that lead him to this point.Review: 127 Hours is a rare movie that grabs you by the balls in the first ten seconds and keeps squeezing until the tension is unbearable. Considering the confined corridor the film takes place in, along with the limited cast of characters, this seems like a near Herculean task. But, with Danny Boyle's wiz bang direction and James Franco giving the most entertaining performance of the year, the film moves with a grace unmatched by most modern filmmakers. The cinematography is great, everything from a ""Holy crap this is insane!"" mountain biking montage through beautiful Canyonlands park to the sheer number of different shots used to highlight Aron's predicament while trapped in the canyon. Although spending an hour in a canyon sounds like it would be boring beyond belief, Boyle keeps it interesting through flashbacks that show the experiences that led Aron to become trapped, as well as premonitions of his future should he escape his natural prison. Also punctuated throughout the film are Aron's attempts to escape, ranging from a brutish attempt to dislodge the rock with force to a gradual attempt to erode the rock by picking at it with a knife that pales in comparison to anything the Swiss army would use. These attempts, although ultimately useless, are exhilarating to watch and build nicely to a nerve shattering climax.Of course, all of this would be useless without a lead that could carry the story. Fortunately, Franco is more than up to the task. Jumping between moments of comedy and charisma to soul crushing scenes of defeat and agony, Mr. Franco never misses a beat in a performance that is worthy of all praise being bestowed upon it. Unfortunately, the film isn't without its problems. While some flashback scenes work towards creating a personality for Aron while giving perspective on his past, a large number of them revolving around a past relationship are underdeveloped and do little to deepen the character or put Aron's current situation into some form of context. There are also some poor visual effects in the form of CG ants that torment Aron and a few shots of the trapped arm that accentuate some of its faker features.Despite these minor gripes, 127 Hours is one hell of a ride. Franco's performance is a roller-coaster in and of itself, the movie stays taunt and entertaining throughout, and the jaw dropping cinematography more than makes up for the price of Admission.

James Franco plays the man, and we feel bad for him in the way a normal human being would feel bad for any other human being in a similar situation. But we certainly don't feel invested in him as a character, because the material doesn't allow Franco to create one. There are some flashbacks that give us a peek into the man's life before the accident, and it's from these that we are to absorb the film's trite moral lessons (things like you should appreciate the people you love more and shouldn't take a single day for granted). But really the whole movie is really just build-up to the money shot scene, when Franco's character saws off his arm, which is admittedly pretty hard to watch but isn't really the hook on which to hang an entire movie.Boyle typically over-directs the film to within an inch of its life. The director he most reminds me of is Joel Schumacher, which -- trust me -- is not a compliment. He clearly doesn't think we as his audience have the intelligence or attention span to stick with a story that takes place in such static settings, so keeps the film constantly jittering along in a way that distracts us from the story rather than enhancing it.

I had a very short list of movies for this board but I can safely say I can add one more to that list and it's called ""127 Hours."" This movie is a spectacular collaboration of emotional images, mental break downs, and the power of the human will to live. This movie grabs your attention right from the beginning and moves your butt right to the edge of the seat. You will be stuck there staring at the screen until the very end and then and only then you will finally sit back in relief. I wouldn't normally do a spoiler review but in his case I am because it is a true story and through out the movie you know the ending. This is a sign of a create film because you know the ending but yet you can't look away from the screen where in most cases, when you now the end of a movie it becomes uninteresting. This movie is more than just watching a man try to make it out of what seems to be an impossible situation to survive. James Franco did an absolutely amazing job at playing the role of Aron Ralston and really showing what went through his mind during the 127 hours he was trapped. When Aron started to hallucinate he saw his family, friends, and a love he once had. He would flashback to all the great times he had with all of them and he would break down every time a little more inside yet give him the strength to stay alive. He had even given up and it seemed he was done. He video taped himself during a psycho break down, doing a talk show with himself has he played all the characters. He began to talk about how stupid he was to not tell anyone where he was going. He talked about how even his friend Chris wouldn't know he was gone till the weekend. Even if Chris reported him missing police can't take action for 24 hours and at that point he would be dead for sure. After he was finished with his break down video he snapped back to reality. He started thanking his parents for everything they had done for him and that he wishes that he had responded to every call that she gave him throughout his life. You can see in his face when he was taping that he knew he was going to die and the emotion was just pour out of his body. He made you feel that emotion in yourself as you watched the film and all you can do is just hope he makes it out alive.Finally at the end of the movie, after now surviving on his own urination, he see's what I believe is his nephew on the other side of the rock on a couch in the sand. He see's himself playing with him and picking him up playing around and having fun. He realizes there is no chance of getting out of here in any reasonable way, so he kneels down and puts pressure on his arm and snap! He breaks his arm and continues to break it even more. He pulls out his dull knife and begins to cut his arm where he had broken the bone. He is soon stopped by a nerve that seems to painful to cut. This scene itself makes every muscle in your body tense up for 20 seconds and you won't be able to relax. When he finally cuts that cord your entire body twitches in relief. He cuts the rest of his arm off and he escapes from what seemed to be certain death. When he falls backwards and looks at the rock that has trapped and stopped his life for 5 days, you are looking at a man that came back from the dead. When you see this part of the film you watch with ""ahhhh"" and you almost don't know how to feel but you almost want to cry because he made it out after everything he went through.This movie is one of the greatest films I have ever seen and I give it a solid 9/10. If you haven't had the pleasure of seeing this movie you need to go out, buy a movie ticket, and see this movie as soon as you can.

Aron Ralston amazing story is one of the most gripping accounts in memory about an episode that almost killed him. Make no mistake, this is a difficult film to sit through.A mountain climbing week-end, and exploration in the breathtaking Utah's Blue John Canyon turns into the biggest ordeal this young man had to endure. What starts as a fun time going through the rugged territory, turns into a nightmare when Aron falls into a narrow passage and a huge rock crashes his hand. Aron is left to fend for himself trying to get himself extricated from the rock that immobilized him. In spite of the nature of the story, Aron's positive attitude saves him from what would have been a sure death if he would not have been able to get out of the situation. Throughout his ordeal Aron Ralston is even able to reflect on the quality of the tools his mother had given him as a present for his activities. All he asks himself is his wisdom for not taking his reliable Swiss Army knife that must have been his companion in different trips, rather than the Chinese kit he got as a present.That Aron Ralston was able to tell his story is a document about human survival. This young man showed a courage that speaks volumes. Had he despaired with the blow he received, he certainly would not have been able to find a solution to the situation. The film is based on Aron Ralston's book ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"", adapted for the screen by the director of the film, Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy. The creators take us for a fantastic adventure to witness what it must have been like during those five days and seven hours that Aron almost died. In spite of the type of situation Aron endures, it is not a claustrophobic situation because, in a way, we realize Mr. Ralston had a somewhat bittersweet end in the ordeal he went through. The impressive music score by A.R. Rahman, who had worked with the director previously, adds texture to the narrative. The great camera work by Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle, gives a fantastic look to the production.James Franco is the whole picture. The actor shows his talent by capturing the essence of the man he is impersonating. One feels his anguish, his despair, his hope for survival, and his courage in dealing with a situation that for someone else might have been a tragedy impossible to overcome. Mr. Franco gives the best performance of his career.Danny Boyle loves to give his audiences bigger than life films. Well, with this one, he clearly outdid himself.

127 Hours,588,Baron Ronan Doyle (imagiking@gmail.com),04/Feb/11,6,1.3382466895302245e-07,film one not story films time way just director little enough two heart performance though people many ever something character year take screen moments might,0.428571429,7.0,inf,inf,inf," It's difficult, around this time of year, to maintain one's cynicism toward awards ceremonies. So many major winners of the last decade have, to me, seemed so horridly overrated that it is difficult to lend any credence to an Oscar nomination anymore. Nonetheless, I was drawn into the premise of 127 Hours: the prospect of a single setting, and the ever likable James Franco.A true-life story of climber/canyoneer Aron Ralston, 127 Hours follows the character as he sets out for the weekend to Blue John canyon. Having told nobody where he is going, Ralston intends to fully enjoy the escapism the wilderness brings. This self-imposed isolation becomes a burden, however, when he finds himself trapped, a fallen boulder crushing his arm against a crevasse wall.The praise heaped upon writer/director Danny Boyle following his previous effort Slumdog Millionaire is indelibly related to the cynicism mentioned above. Slumdog, for me, was a perfectly fine film, but in no way deserving of such championing. Boyle's position as director was something of a bad omen as such, leaving me slightly worried about what might happen with the film. These worries appear justified almost immediately, Boyle splitting the screen to a triptych (though technically not) showing large crowds of people. This carries on for almost ten minutes, the broken screen fine for a credit sequence but rapidly tired-out and overused almost immediately after. Thankfully it subsides eventually, allowing us to take in the wonderful setting of the film. The vast canyon expanse is quite, quite beautiful, given appropriate treatment with wide angle lenses. It is fewer than twenty minutes before Ralston becomes trapped, the trailer-featured scenes with two female fellow adventurers apparently consisting of the entirety of their presence in the film. Not that I'm complaining, mind; sitting in a canyon with James Franco was what I paid to do. And Franco is wonderful, his performance carrying the film exactly as it needs to. One moment in particular, immediately after Ralston's hallucinatory imagining of a talk show, demonstrates perfectly Franco's humanity in this role. Unfortunately, Boyle seems to have insufficient confidence in entrusting the entirety of the film to the strength of Franco's performance, and consequentially we are left with regular flashbacks, imagined party scenes, bizarre appearances of Scooby Doo, and agonisingly infuriating gimmicky camera-work. It seems as though the film is trying to add a layer of quirky geekiness to its effects, and these prove little more than distracting and deprecating, leaving us with fewer moments of pure performance. An additional qualm comes in the form of Ralston's character as expressed in the film. I found his story inescapably comparable to that of Christopher McCandless, the inspiration behind Sean Penn's infinitely superior Into the Wild. Unlike Into the Wild, 127 Hours does not manage to build itself a protagonist with sufficient depth of characterisation to craft a meaningful message, resigning itself instead to the status of mere story. We emerge from 127 Hours with little on our minds to consider, save the reuse of that damned triptych effect.Though its star delivers a very fine performance__when the director has faith enough to allow him to perform, that is__127 Hours just seems inconsequential, inconclusive, and disappointing. This is the sort of film from which one should take home a message of sorts, but the thinly-sketched and unconflicted character at its heart prevents any such meaningfulness. Oddly enough, it's this film's potential which drags it down.

Unable to free himself, cocky climber, Aron Rolston (James Franco), is driven to cut off the limb with a blunt blade. Had a lesser-known character been in the directing chair then this could have easily been brushed off as another monotonous, slow-moving piece of dross whereby the viewer is left waiting for the inevitable. Remember Open Water? The skeptics will be pleased to hear that the great British filmmaker hasn't lost the plot. 127 Hours is held together by the bursts of intensity that Boyle is renowned for. The camera gets right up as if to smell to Rolston; its gets inside his water bottle; and it buries under his skin. Stylistic finesse is abandoned in favour of an ugly closeness as we see one man degenerate into a urine-guzzling nutter. The most basic of narratives is infused with spouts of paranoia, nostalgia and delirium. As Rolston defiantly stares death in the face, the audience is treated to a series of anecdotes and fantasies. Through this period of self-reflection Aron admits to his own selfishness. He calls out to his mother, his father and his sister. But as his imagination takes over, a sensuous love story develops into bouts of pleasure and heartbreak. Not all of 127 Hours is played out through delusional mind-tricks. Canon must have scooped the biggest product-placement deal of 2011 as much of Aron's confessions and messages are recorded on a hand-held video-camera. His rendition of a morning talkshow is a particular highlight. Having been tortured through the cheesy 'snapshot' sound-bites, one can only feel a sense of frustration and disappointment that this real-life documentation is not revealed in the credits, at least. Instead, we are introduced to the real Aron Rolston through a pathetically banal on-sofa-with-wife-and-baby shot. The soundtrack is drawn, in part, from popular music. Though this may sometimes feel misplaced, it makes the film work in mysterious ways, juxtaposing Bill Withers' 'Lovely Day' to a scene of screaming agony. At the darkest of moments horrific shudders of a cracking bone thunder through the audience. Yet the overwhelming audio-effect is to build up the feel-good factor of what would otherwise have been rather grim film.Boyle has blasted out a spiced up version of Touching the Void Never to give a roller-coaster ride. Full of guilty cinematic pleasures, 127 Hours is worth seeing on the big screen. Never before has such a limited plot been executed with such vibrancy.

It is a celebration of the great victory of a man overcoming death and finding the will to survive. This film is such an intense experience. Director Danny Boyle and James Franco take us on an exhilarating journey of the shock, acceptance, regret, anger, and hope that resulted in this reviewer squirting a few tears of joy. ""127 Hours"" is the story of a life inspired put on screen and easily one of the better films of the year.Based on best selling memoir, ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"", Ralston recounts the events that took place in Utah's Blue John Canyon in April of 2003. Boyle introduces us to the film and to Ralston with an energetic opening split screen of dutch shots (static shot from a slanted angle) of busy crowds alongside Ralston hurriedly grabbing his gear in his apartment for his weekend trip. Boyle doesn't drop the hammer right away, instead showing the exuberance of Ralston playing in his nirvana. When Aron comes upon two pretty girls lost in Blue John he plays guide and shows the ladies the best way to reach the deep bright blue lake. Ralston parts with the girls, skipping off to his next destination.Shortly thereafter, the solitary Ralston slips resulting in his arm being stuck. This is where the film would have been lost with a lesser actor. But Franco seizes every scene as he and Boyle begin to put us through the emotional ringer. Franco impressively relays those first few moments of paralyzed shock, to angrily realizing his will and determination alone aren't enough to save him, to beginning to assess the situation and think his way out. The only things he has with him are his camcorder, watch, climbing gear, a cheap dull knife and most importantly, very little food and even less water. Ralston's greatest asset is that, for the most part, he is not one who panics, which Franco maneuvers by using his goofy nature to keep his wits about him.Since Ralston is the sole character on screen for the majority of the movie, Danny Boyle uses music as another character. Opening with the kinetic ""Never Hear Surf Music Again"" from Free Blood, to pulling an exhausted Ralston and audience back up with Bill Withers ""Lovely Day"", Boyle never lets the film get stagnant from the restraints of his location. This is due in great part of his successful decision to use two cinematographers in Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak. The two different visions play off each other as Aron Ralston struggles with the physical and psychological effects of being trapped. Extreme close-ups of Franco and nifty camera shots through the water bottle keep the viewer tightly encased with Aron.What Boyle really gets right is putting us in Aron's head. The longer Aron is forced to look death in the eye, the more his memories, nightmares, and delusions pop up. When Aron's mind races all the way back to his vehicle for the Gatorade he left on the seat, as commercial visions of beverage refreshment take over, I've never been so thirsty. Regrets and an inner look at his life's decisions become more agonizing than the physical aspect. Realizing his selfishness of not picking up his mother's phone calls or letting the girl get away, torment Aron but it's the vision of what life has in store for him that ultimately leads him out of peril. When the self-amputation scene arrives it may be too strong for some but it is necessary. The intensity it takes to do such a thing creates a powerful moment that won't quickly leave your memory. Inspired is the best word for what remains because you're left there finding what you want to live for and how you'd lose an arm to do it. When Ralston miraculously sees people, he screams, ""I need help"", for the first time in his life allowing himself not to be a superhero.""127 Hours"" is definitely up there with ""Trainspotting"" as one of Danny Boyle's best films and I don't need to say it but I will anyway; it's a foregone conclusion that James Franco will be nominated for Best Actor and at this point I've seen no other performance that would beat it.I've seen no other performance that would beat ""this"" Matthew 24:13Â    ","   end  ""127 Hours""  Aron Ralston (James Franco) gruesomely removes    800-pound boulder  arm  pinned , ,  audience,  left   euphoric state.    celebration   great victory   man overcoming death  finding  will  survive.  film    intense experience.

One person stuck in a confined place for the whole length of the film. But while in ""Buried"" the director was able to keep the entire film inside the box and never ""cheated"" by giving the audience flashbacks or shots of whatever was happening in the outside world, here in ""127 Hours"" director Danny Boyle uses every trick in the book to make the visual more exciting and sometimes to the expense of the emotional response that one should have for a story of this kind. Split screens, speeded up/trippy sequences, long zooms out from a tiny close up of James Franco's face to the widest view of the Canyon. Surely it makes it all exciting to watch, yes the photography is beautiful (2 different Directors of Photography were used for this film. And by the way that first bicycle riding sequence is really breath-taking), yes the editing is as flashy as it can be (in fact I think it's easier to produce showy editing of this kinds than proper invisible one__ But then again, wait and see how this one will win the Oscar), but when it comes to getting really close to our main character, knowing his history, his background, his life, that's when the film fails for me. Listening to a Q&A sessions with the makers at the end of the film, I was actually intrigued to hear about the real story and I started longing for a documentary about it__ Hold on a second__ Would I need a documentary if the film had satisfied me completely? It's really not James Franco's fault! He gives the performance of his career and I can easily see an Oscar nomination coming his way, the problem is that Boyle is so preoccupied about whizzes and bangs, about his visual flashy style and about making you feel so trapped like the main character has, that he forgets what the story (and the original book) was really be about: a cathartic experience about a man who's accepted his own death and looks back at his life realising all the mistakes he's done. In the end it just becomes a story about the power of self preservation. It's absolutely not a bad film, but this one could have been so much deeper and fuller, at least to match the fullness of the visuals (and its soundtrack too, I should add, as always in a Boyle's film, was very accomplished). People will love, I'm sure about that, but I really wanted a masterpiece out of this one, like the trailer made it look like. At the end of the day, the style of the film won over the actual substance e reduced it to just a good one, but not a great one. Moviegeekblog.

The film takes place in 2003 in Moab, Utah.Aron Ralston (Franco) is a mountain climber who decides to go to the place in Moab, Utah where he has the whole course memorized for his daily thrill. While bike riding, walking, and running around he meets up with two girls Kristi (Mara) and Megan (Tamblyn) and for a short while the three of them go climbing and swimming and all that crazy stuff. Well after the girls leave he gets himself into quite a predicament. While jumping onto a branch he slips and knocks a rock down which crushes his right arm. Oops. The rest of the film is about hallucinations he is having and flashbacks to his family and an old girlfriend. That's why I don't mountain climb, I just write film reviews so I can't my arm crushed.The screenplay by Simon Beaufoy and Danny Boyle was pretty good. This film could have been equally torturous for the viewer as it was for Aron Ralston but it didn't really drag on for the full length of the film, it flowed nicely. The problem with a true story is that the second you go in there you know how it's going to end so the whole time I was like none of this matters I know what's going to happen. I did not see the need to put the flashbacks of his girlfriend in there because it never led up to anything, it didn't even really help with characterization it just showed that Ralston once had a girlfriend but now he's trapped in a canyon. The dialogue for the whole of the film was very believable, usually when one person is talking to themselves it doesn't work out very well but here it works very nicely.Danny Boyle had some pretty stylized direction on this one, and it helped keep the film entertaining throughout. Is this film as good as his previous, Slumdog Millionaire? No. Personally I believe Boyle's best film to be Trainspotting which also had a lot of style and I think Boyle is much more comfortable with stylistic films than something which cannot have a stylistic influence upon it. I like how Boyle does films in multiple genres: Slumdog Millionaire-fantasy, Trainspotting-crime, 28 Days Later-horror, Sunshine-science fiction, and 127 Hours-real life drama. All of Boyles directing decisions I think were fine with this film, the only reason I couldn't give it a higher score is because the story is very limited to a guy trapped in a rock and he couldn't really put in any crazy mind games to add another layer of interest.James Franco easily gave the best performance of his career so far and it would be shocking if he did not receive an Oscar nomination for Best Actor at this year's Academy Awards. Will he win it? I highly doubt it. In the film Aron Ralston is fun, carefree kind of guy who climbs mountains to just to have a good time. When he gets trapped he starts to lose hope and his mind a bit. The part where Franco delivers his best in the film is when he is pretending to interview himself because it just shows how low he has gotten. This is the first time Franco has ever really been in a lead role, I know him mostly for his supporting roles in Spiderman and Pineapple Express, but as a lead man he is very impressive and has a bright career in front of him.The only real supporting cast in this film was Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn as the two girls Ralston meets before he gets trapped. Both girls did a fine job but nothing really noteworthy. They were basically just average girls who are just following a path for fun. There wasn't really enough acting in the flashbacks to criticize but none of them were bad enough to notice.Overall I give this film a 7/10, the only reason I couldn't give it higher was because the script was very limiting and I already knew how it would end since it is a famous story. If you like films like Into the Wild or other man vs. nature type films then you would like this one as well. Franco and Boyle both have very bright careers for the future even though they both had very successful careers before this Franco will make his way as a leading man and Boyle will still be one of the best directors of today.

Leaving him all alone with only his own demons to conquer.

Having gone alone and without having told anyone where he was going, he is stranded. Facing a lack of rations and severe weather conditions, Ralston muses on his relationships with his family and friends, realising that he has foolishly kept everyone at a distance. In the end, he resorts to desperate measures in order to survive.Nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, as well as numerous other accolades, 127 Hours has become something of a surprise hit. However, it has a good many flaws, particularly from a directorial standpoint. Danny Boyle looks and sounds like an absolute chancer. His previous work has been varied at best, with Shallow Grave and Trainspotting being very uneven films that don't work the way they should and Sunshine degenerating from a film with a lot of potential into a stupid and crass slasher film. To put it simply, Danny Boyle's films would be good if someone else made them.127 Hours sees Boyle back to his old tricks. The opening ten minutes employ all sorts of flashy editing tricks, from split-screens to jump cuts. This is done presumably to show how vacuous Ralston's adrenaline fuelled lifestyle is, a form of extroverted misanthropic loneliness. But Boyle doesn't quit. Even when Ralston is trapped to the canyon and largely immobile, the camera jumps all over the place, shooting in and out of the canyon and filming him from inside a water bottle (more of which later). An attempt at creating a mood of isolation and helplessness is constantly undercut by Boyle's prancing and dancing camera. For a proper film about a character stuck alone in a small space see Buried.What's worse is that Boyle's apparent showboating tarnishes everything else in the film. James Franco is very impressive, delivering a performance that is entirely convincing and a genuine step up for the actor. However, Boyle's impatient and jittery film cannot hold a shot long enough for us to feel properly introduced to Franco's character. We rarely even get to have a good view of him, as the shots used prioritise extreme close-ups and shots from behind Franco. We are never given the chance to watch a performance and by the end it doesn't even seem like he has changed all that much. A case in point, the previously mentioned shot from inside Ralston's water bottle. At this point in the film, Ralston decides to just finish his water and be done with it. Here, what is of interest is Franco's performance, playing a man completely at the end of his tether. Instead, Boyle shows us what a water bottle would see when someone is drinking out of it. The shot does not look good and it does not further the drama, it is just ridiculous. And, as such, it is incredibly annoying.Because the final sequence fails to be life affirming and joyous, largely due to the fact that Boyle shoots it like a typically terrible ""X Factor"" human-interest montage (as well as this, the apparently vacuous split-screen sequence returns, destroying any sense that Ralston has been changed for the better by his experience), the end result is a film that feels like it has been sabotaged by a director desperate to be noticed. Every good thing about the film, from its performances to its cinematography to its general theme, is undermined by a camera in constant search of a cool, new angle to shoot from and frenetic editing that won't let you get a good look at anything. A real pity.

His talent for creating memorable images, powerful compositions and suspenseful, energetic shots is stronger on 127 Hours than it was on any of his films since Trainspotting. Cinematically, 127 Hours is a very solid piece, beautifully shot and edited, and complimented by a marvelous performance from Franco.And yet, at the same time, Boyle also shows just how incompetent he is at constructing a coherent and well-paced film. The chaos that worked for Trainspotting did not work well on any of his other works, and it fails here too. The biggest problem 127 has is that it begins and ends at the middle. We get no character development, no structure, no build-up, no satisfying ending - we're expected to get into the action right away, and just as quickly the film ends seconds after the climax. For that reason 127 feels more like a music video than a film. It has no real characters; the few flashbacks the protagonist has seem like a pretty lame cover-up for that fact, giving him a background and a family as generic as possible.It's pretty shocking, in fact, that a story this dark and shocking can eventually feel so light on film. Despite the grimness of the whole situation, it feels like a lighter version of Into the Wild. Which is why, as powerful as the film is while you're watching it, it leaves absolutely no lasting impression - which is criminal for a story like this. It's probably a good thing that it's short then, because it's just long enough to enjoy the visuals and Franco's acting, to be mildly shocked the way you would be at a news broadcast, and then to move on with your life.

Nobody knew I was making the hike except that I signed my name in at the trail head. As I started to head up, I noticed rescue helicopters flying around overhead. I made it to the top of the mountain and came back down safely, but later found out that a climber before me had slipped off a cliff and died. While it is exhilarating to be alone in the great outdoors, enjoying God's amazing creation, it made me realize why they always say it's better to climb with a buddy. Instead of acting like I was invincible, I probably should have called my wife and told her my plans. What is it about being a loner that makes some of us feel more significant? Why do we find pleasure in ""going it alone,"" shunning doing things in community, brushing off relationships as if they are burdens? In 127 Hours, James Franco plays Aron Ralston, who famously became trapped in a Utah canyon for five days when a falling boulder pinned his hand, making him helpless to escape until he boldly cut off his own arm. Ralston is portrayed as a man who acts as if he is a living Mountain Dew commercial, taking off on a Mountain Bike into the depths of Utah canyon country, alone with his only companions, his camcorder and digital camera, to explore and survive what nature has for him. I expected to identify with Ralston's character. I was looking forward to vicariously exploring those canyons with him and experiencing the excitement of figuring out a way to survive on pure cunning. For two hours, I wanted to be that cool loner-guy, the guy that the girls find irresistible because he doesn't need them for a good time. What surprised me is that I am far more like Ralston than I'd like to admit, but not in the ways I expected.What Writer/Director Danny Boyle does with this film is allow us into the inner thoughts of the main character as he discovers his personal flaws through the crisis he faces. He discovers that he has neglected his relationships in favor of a persona that he wants for himself, the man-against-nature guy who doesn't need other people. In a humorous scene, Ralston turns on his camcorder and pretends to be a talk show host interviewing himself. Ralston playing the Talk Show Host: ""Aron, from Loser's Canyon, Utah, how do you know so much?"" Ralston: ""I volunteer for the Rescue Service. You see, I am something of a, uh, well a big @#%@ hard hero, and I can do everything on my own, you see?"" Talk Show Host: ""I do see."" (wink) ""Now, is it true that despite, or maybe because you're a big @#%@ hard hero, you didn't tell anyone where you were going?"" Ralston: ""Uh, yea, that is absolutely correct."" Talk Show Host: ""Anyone?"" Ralston: ""Anyone."" Talk Show Host: ""Oops!"" (grin) Ralston: ""Oops."" (look of dismay)Ralston then goes on to leave a message on the videotape for his parents, confessing that he had not appreciated them like he should have. It is the pivotal moment in the movie. We see in Franco's face the sorrow that he feels, and we are moved. James Franco is amazing in this film, able to convey the inner man of Aron Ralston's emotion__fear, sadness, whimsy, and humor__not only through his interaction with his video camera, but also simply through his facial expressions.Anthony Dod Mantle, who won the Academy Award for Cinematography for Boyle's previous film, Slumdog Millionaire, and Jon Harris, who did the film editing, should have both won Oscars for this film. This movie is basically about a lone guy stuck in a narrow canyon, not exactly the kind of material for an exciting film, but it moves with an almost frenetic pace, perfectly capturing the intensity of the main character's personality. Ralston dreams, has nightmares and hallucinations, and through these we see into the inner workings of Ralston's mind as he reflects on his life__of a failed relationship with a girl, of his growing up with his parents and sister, of his encounter with a couple of hikers on the trail. All these chaotic images create a picture of a man who finally is getting what life is really all about. Brilliant. If you are anything like me, you get caught up in your own private world and agenda far too much, shirking the very relationships that bring vitality to life. It is sad that it is only in those moments of crisis that we finally realize how dear community and family really is. When I personally nearly died five years ago, all I cared about was my family and friends. Five years later, I again take them all for granted. Sad.To be human is to live in relationships. It is part of the warping of our psyche that we believe that we are better off alone. Americans are more socially isolated today than they have ever been, disconnected with others as they seclude themselves from people. We think that being human is being able to go it alone, but in reality, being human is being interconnected with others. We actually become less human the more we scorn relationships. And yet, we are constantly taking our most treasured relationships for granted. An ancient text reads, ""If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up!"" It goes on to say, ""A cord of three strands is not quickly broken."" (Ecclesiastes 4:9-12).There is great wisdom in this. Let us not stop getting together with others in real relationships, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another. ","  remember   solo climb   14,000 foot mountain  Colorado.

Tragedy struck when a giant boulder came crashing down on him, smashing and pinning his right arm so that Walston was actually left dangling a few feet above the ground. After more than five days in this position, he made the horrific decision to cut off the arm, thereby free himself from his predicament.Given the shockingly gruesome nature of the material, it's possible that many people avoided watching this movie when it played in theaters. One of the advantages of seeing the movie on DVD is that the faint of heart can fast-forward through the more unsettling parts and not miss out on the overall experience __ or James Franco's dazzling and empathic tour-de-force performance.Moments of lucidity alternate with moments of intense unreality and confusion as the hours tick off and Walston increasingly struggles against hunger, thirst, cold, pain and mounting desperation. What strikes one most about Walston is the amazing resourcefulness and calm demeanor he demonstrates while confronting a situation most of us can imagine only in our worst nightmares. Walston certainly has time to think back over his life and to consider what exactly brought him to this moment in time and to contemplate the people who've made the deepest impact on him, and how he's treated - and, in some cases, mistreated - them throughout the course of his life.Walston's ordeal resonates with viewers in that it shows us just how vulnerable we are to the cruel exigencies of an indifferent Nature, and how one little mistake or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time can forever seal our fate.Director Danny Boyle and co-writer Simon Beaufry keep things from becoming unduly claustrophobic by throwing hallucinations, memories and imaginings into the narrative mix and by freely indulging in the hyperkinetic montage sequences that have long been the hallmark of Boyle's style (see ""Trainspotting"" and ""Slumdog Millionaire"").In terms of acting, this is pretty much a one-man show, but there are important contributions from Amber Tamblyn, Kate Mara and Treat Williams in small but significant roles.Hard as it may be to sit through at times, ""127 Hours"" provides us with an unforgettable and ultimately inspiring portrait of a man staring into the face of Death __ and making Death blink.

Aron Ralston, the hero of the ninth feature film by the skillful, vitalizing Irish director Danny Boyle, has one of those. He goes hiking in the rough country without telling anyone where he's going, and then in a cavernous, constricted crevice, gets his forearm ensnared between a boulder and the canyon wall. What would you do? I'm not sure if I could've done what he does. It entails a grisly test for Aron, and for us. It's not always easy watching him do it. Yet, as always, from such traumatic roots, it's quite awe-inspiring what a compelling and gratifying film Danny Boyle has made out of it.As gut-wrenching as it is genuinely moving, this flashy, rousing but ultimately intimate and inspiring adventure docudrama fuses one of Boyle's most stunningly lively directorial efforts with an excellent performance from James Franco. For the bulk he contends with one approximately 10-foot-radius space, and one actor. There's a happy-go-lucky preamble in which Aron and a pair of young trekkers have a swim in an underwater cave. Later, in figments of the imagination, other people and pared-down events from his life appear to pop in.The film heroes who involve me most are not loud. They don't swagger to a beat, make lugubrious moral proclamations and restore faith in the inherent good of the world. They're common people confronted with a necessity and face their predicament. Indeed, Boyle interestingly enough refers to as his version of The Wrestler in regards to creating the portrait of an existentially desperate protagonist. Franco does first-rate work signifying the two necessary features of Ralston's character. He's a brash, overconfident traveler who trusts his dexterity and loves skating on thin ice, and, contrarily though it'd seem, he's got horse sense and animal instinct enough to do inconceivable but necessary things to himself to survive. One characteristic finds his predicament, and the other solves it.The question is, Can you take it? It's absolutely gripping. Films like this are neither fast-paced nor leisurely. They feel largely like they're all one moment. They exploit our profound nightmare of being confined somewhere and finding that there doesn't appear to be any means of escaping. Aaron is at any rate opportune to be standing on a stable footing. One can imagine the boulder lodging a little higher, leaving him suspended from the ensnared arm.Abruptly, his world has become very clear. There's the crevice, the sliver of sky above, traversed by an eagle on its recurring flight path, his camcorder, decreasing water and food and his insufficient little utensil. Who can hear him shout? The two girls have long since made tracks and won't realize he's missing. For anyone to happen to discover him is unimaginable. He'll die or act.Equal parts food for thought and triumph of the spirit, 127 Hours is a task in overcoming the unfilmable. Boyle employs superb cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak, determining the immensity of the Utah wilds, and the extremely particular minutiae of Ralston's trivial ration of it. His editor, Jon Harris, accomplishes the subtle mission of showing his crucial act of bodily harm exclusive of ever totally showing it. For us, the nastiest moment is not an image but a blood-curdling, stomach-turning sound. Most of us have never heard this sound before, although we know precisely what it is.Torture and violence are so everyday in the movies. They're seldom amplified to the degree of true medical reality. We and the characters feel impervious. 127 Hours eliminates the sieve. It connects us. One aspect that cinema can indicate but can't induce is the violence of the grief concerned. I can't conceive of what Aaron endures. Possibly, that made it simpler for the real Ralston, because no matter how, his choice controlled the length of his misery.Boyle's stylized, claustrophobic drama warily doesn't make him a hero, more of a skilled sportsperson caught by a transitory determination.

Aaron was going deep into the canyons it was -100 meters when suddenly he slipped and on him fell a huge rock, he didn't freak out a lot and just stared at it and then comes my favourite part, when he falls and gets his hand jammed, next to it appears the title of the movie ""127 hours"" meaning yup this is where you're going to spend your 90 minutes. During all this 127 hours getting stuck you see Aaron trying to chip the stone, talk to the camera, leave messages, hallucinate and daydream. Ahh yes daydreaming was what Aaron did a lot, you see him think of the women he liked, partying with his friends and thinking about drinks, for he didn't have a lot of water left with him. Aaron starts to think about his parents a lot and record himself saying how much he loved them, he starts seeing himself when he was 19 years old 10 and 4. And then he realises he has to rise.It is a heart pumping movie, especially when he is left with no choice but to amputate his arm, this is where all the good sound effects come in breaking the bone, cutting of his arteries and nerves.

127 Hours,620,Jake Sturgess,16/Mar/11,8,1.6598313719517988e-11,film one not story will well films time can way life characters much just little great two only see heart made performance old entertaining cast without something real often sense year kind man screen cinema far right might,0.0,2.0,inf,inf,," 127 Hours is the harrowing account of one man, Aron Ralston, and his six day battle with nature. This true story documents the time Aron spent pinned by the arm to the wall of an isolated Utah canyon until he is able to, horrifically and with great sacrifice, free himself. If the thought of 92 minutes of cinema set predominantly in three square metres of sunless canyon seems a little too heavy, I implore you do not be put off. Danny Boyle is at his finest here, and conjures from the sterility of the situation a thoroughly entertaining and uplifting journey. Quite a task this must have been too, one can only applaud Boyle for not slipping into the kind of tooth grinding, headache inducing endurance test such enclosing subject matter often brings forth from directors - Rodrigo Cort Ãs' Buried, comes to mind. But no indeed, 127 Days escapes such pitfalls (no pun intended) and is a masterful, enjoyable and massively entertaining piece of cinema. Boyle's outstanding direction of such an iconic story would, however, be left inert without such an engaging and ambitious performance from the (might I say oddly cast) James Franco. The actor seamlessly slips between the easygoing humour to which he must by now be accustomed, and something much darker and deeper. Franco far from shies away from the demands of such a difficult and demanding role, and instead throws himself commendably into the unfamiliar territory of immense and delicate emotion. The opening scene shows adrenaline junkie Aron (Franco) excitedly preparing for his trip to the canyons. Viewers who are aware of Aron's story prior to watching the film will cringe as his fingers search fruitlessly for his Swiss Army knife, inches out of reach at the back of a cupboard. (Those who aren't aware will cringe later on). Impatiently he sets off, and through the hustle and life of the split screens (owing to Boyle's talented editor Jon Harris) Aron's journey away from civilisation begins. Franco's vigour and vivacity are apparent from the moment he puts his headphones on and races off on his mountain bike, A. R. Rahman's eclectic soundtrack resonating in his eardrums. On his way he runs into two like-minded, free spirited hikers (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) who had gotten lost among the trails. While he gives them his own guided tour of the canyons the two girls who serve as the only real- time conversation in the vast majority of the film, and soon after they part ways Aron's life changing accident happens. In hastily traversing a narrow canyon, Aron dislodges a boulder which falls, crushing his right arm against the stone. The 27 year old, who has been racing round with blistering pace since the opening scene is now locked in place, and the next 127 hours of the his life are spent in this horrifying predicament. Unable to dislodge his arm nor move the boulder, and with no phone, minimal equipment, and only one bottle of water, Aron's mind becomes a hub of panic and mania. It is here that we see Franco's most credible acting to date. The actor maintains his affable humour, which comes across well in the imaginary chat show discussion about his entrapment (the conclusive word of which being a quiet, dry 'oops') but what is most commendable about his performance is its uncharacteristic subtlety. With no dialogue Franco must react and respond only to his character's thoughts and actions, and he does so flawlessly, succeeding with the smallest of gestures or expressions to communicate the grave reality of his fear. The film's crescendo is the most visceral and thigh-clawingly graphic moment in the film. In reality, Aron spent 45 minutes with the dull blade separating his body from the rock, but its screen time is, mercifully, much reduced. In vividly portraying the impromptu amputation Boyle is not simply employing shock tactics to repulse his viewer with the gore of the episode. Instead one gets the impression that the scene is far from excessive, and is in fact, commendable in its refusal to shy away from the physicality which lies at the heart of the story. One particular tendon succeeds in inducing a similar reaction from the viewer as from Aron himself before it is stretched and broken with a resounding snap. At the end of it all, there is a sense that not just the amputation, but the course of the entire story is accurately and honestly produced. Aron Ralston had received a huge number of offers from producers since the event in 2003 before finally allowing 127 Hours to be made and ultimately, one gets the impression that justice had been done to the story, if the closing scene's are a little sickly sweet. In spite of everything it's loud and alive, immensely entertaining, and above all uplifting. I challenge any viewer not to smile with genuine content as the credits begin to roll.

Perhaps the biggest lessons you can learn with ""127 Hours"" is always bring a cellphone wherever you'll go, and always, always, tell to everyone you know where are you going, just in the case you get lost in the middle of the desert, with your arm trapped in a canyon, without water to drink and other disasters. This is a movie about what happened to Aron (played by James Franco) and all his ways of survival during those five days with his arm stuck in a canyon in the desert without a phone, not able to call for any help and with his water stock running out, and with only had two choices while being there: death a slowly death or cut off his arm with a knife. Second option is the chosen one and is the most awaited moment in the film. The amputation scene (filmed in one take) is frightening with some good sound effects mixed with the background music. Everything is thrilling here, from the minute where Aron's adventure begins up until his tough and difficult moments in the canyon, thinking about his family and some imaginary moments of a future life outside of the canyon, and his moments after getting out of there. This is a one man show and Franco carries the whole film in a heartbreaking performance. A movie depending on his main star is very difficult to be made and to audiences like (being Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away"" a rare successful example) but Boyle surely found his actor here. Franco is excellent in the whole drama, he's very believable in the risky scenes climbing the canyons, you really can believe that he's a adventurer (although a little bit silly). But if the dramatic scenes, and his breakdown moments are great and conduces the film, it is a funny and surprising moment that really caught my attention, and that is the ""Good Morning"" scene, a hilarious and positive moment where Aron makes fun of himself while in the canyon, creating a TV show where he interviews himself telling his whole situation there. Just a reminder of how positive someone could be even in a dramatic and tense situation, not everyone can do that, and he managed to lighten up the tension of a story that at no point makes us feel distracted, calm, or uninterested. It holds the viewers in the chair at every second, every minute in its short running time.""127 Hours"" doesn't want to deliver a message, or be preachy about anything, it's not philosophical. It is simply a real life event that urges the viewers to see the man's struggle in a shocking event where he only has two choices and both of them are not that good and he's the only one who can do something about it. There's a few lessons to be learned here even for those who are not inclined to enter in an adventure in the middle of the desert.Danny Boyle makes of ""127 Hours"" a triumph in technical qualities, great editing, great music, great sound effects, brilliant cinematography and a powerful performance by James Franco. The final result is a great film about a man against himself in his most difficult and most painful moment of his life. 10/10 ","   go  see Danny Boyle's ""127 Hours""  simply  two choices just   main character trapped   canyon:   watch   leave   without seeing  thing.    want  see  aware  everything  comes   story  Aron Ralston  don't expect  find  howling message   ones given   main character   scenes.  indeed  real story   doesn't fills us  morals, messages  anything similar    common  real life stories.

Basically a one man drama - Aron Ralston (James Franco) - the writers and director have managed to transfer enough outside of the story energy to keep the film in motion at all times. The story is well-known: Aron Ralston (Franco) set out for one of his freewheeling adventures in April 2003 in the canyons of Utah, befriends two girls (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) in hiking distress, and proceeds on his hike only to fall into a crevice with a heavy rock crushing his right hand. The story is about the 127 hours Ralston endures and ultimately survives by excising his own partial right extremity, thus limiting all his efforts to the use of his left hand, freeing himself until he can return home to his parents (Kate Burton and Treat Williams) and his girlfriend (Cl Ãmence Po Ãsy).

He has always been a independent director, and even when taking on larger projects such as Sunshine and The Beach, he has always maintained that low-budget feel. I always look forward to anything Boyle does, and even though I have an almost resentful attitude toward Slumdog due to it's overrated success, I was pleased to hear that he had decided to stick to what he does best and make relatively low-key film that is practically a one-man show. It is also nice that 127 Hours is one of his best.In 2003, reckless thrill-seeker Aron Ralston went rock-climbing and hiking in the canyons of Utah without telling anyone where he was. He meets a couple of female hikers who he takes to a hidden pool and has a bit of fun with before departing to wander the plains on his own. In a bizarre accident, Ralston slips on a loose boulder and falls into a canyon, the boulder falling with him and landing on his arm, completely trapping him. It takes some time for the gravity of the situation to hit Ralston after some initial confusion. He must work out how to escape his predicament or accept his fate, with only a few tools including a blunt pen knife, and very little water for company. It will be of no surprise to know that Aron Ralston does survive the ordeal, and famously had to cut off his own arm with said pen knife in order to escape. The skill of Boyle as a director, and the acting ability of James Franco as our hero, combine to make the film as exciting and nail-biting as a story can be when we already know the outcome.It must have been an ordeal to figure out how to make a 90-minute film about one man stuck in one place for over five days. Kudos goes to editor Jon Harris and cinematographers Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle for using all the tricks in the book to make the visuals consistently interesting and never allowing the action to drag. As Ralston begins to hallucinate as his water rationing begins to take it's toll, a combination of split-screens, distorted colours and inserts from pop culture allow us to be placed into the character's damaged state. The camera-work and editing is fast and flashy, much like the character of Aron Ralston himself - always living fast, sometimes too fast for his own good. It's obvious that Danny Boyle is in a deft hand when directing his films this way. It's evident in the fantastic Trainspotting, as Ewan McGregor's Renton goes cold turkey on his heroin addiction, and in the first hour of Slumdog, as he depicts the madness and colour of the slums. It would be difficult to see imagine another director taking on such as challenge with so much confidence and flair.Which moves us to James Franco's Oscar-nominated lead performance. If this film is a reliable source, and due to the fact it has received Ralston's stamp of authenticity I imagine it is, Aron Ralston is a complete nob head, and is exactly the type of person I would avoid in real life. He is careless, arrogant and cocky, and is only interested in fulfilling his own desires. Franco manages to convince of this totally, and yet I found myself rooting for him as his situation worsens. It's a staggering performance, and from the other I've seen in the Best Actor category (Jeff Bridges and Jesse Eisenberg), he is my favourite. It's a performance of maturity, and in some scenes he is reminiscent of a young Robert De Niro. It's not mean feat to carry a 90 minute film almost completely by yourself, and it hasn't been done so well since Tom Hanks did it in the underrated Cast Away. The scene in which Ralston stages a pretend game-show into his video camera with himself as both host and guest, Franco delivers both shame and over-the-top insanity as Ralston reflects on his attitudes and his recklessness. It's a fantastic scene for Franco, and deserves to win him the Oscar alone.Not to say that their aren't problems with the film. Towards the end it begins to get unnecessarily sentimental as Ralston starts to think of his family, who he has constantly neglected, watching over him. And when the 'long-awaited' arm removal scene comes, I didn't know what to make of it. Boyle uses sound effects and quick editing which renders the scene easier to watch, and I wasn't sure whether to see this as a cop- out or not. I felt that it is something Ralston went through and it would only be right to show it how it happened, but on the other hand it is more tastefully done. It could have been exploitative in the hands of a poorer director, and I suppose it heightens the absurdity of his circumstance. Given the height of disillusionment and dehydration he was in at the time, he probably didn't experience it in a regular way anyway.A solid survival flick, and a refreshingly stylish take on it. It deserves to be seen for Franco's performance alone, who I assume will prosper from this to become a highly-sought after leading man.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","    wonder  direction Danny Boyle  take   phenomenal success,  critically  commercially,  2008's Slumdog Millionaire.   always   independent director,  even  taking  larger projects   Sunshine   Beach,   always maintained  low-budget feel.  always look forward  anything Boyle ,  even though    almost resentful attitude  Slumdog due   overrated success,   pleased  hear    decided  stick     best  make relatively low-key film   practically  one-man show.   also nice  127 Hours  one   best.In 2003, reckless thrill-seeker Aron Ralston went rock-climbing  hiking   canyons  Utah without telling anyone   .  meets  couple  female hikers   takes   hidden pool    bit  fun   departing  wander  plains   .   bizarre accident, Ralston slips   loose boulder  falls   canyon,  boulder falling    landing   arm, completely trapping .  takes  time   gravity   situation  hit Ralston   initial confusion.  must work    escape  predicament  accept  fate,  only   tools including  blunt pen knife,   little water  company.  will   no surprise  know  Aron Ralston  survive  ordeal,  famously   cut    arm  said pen knife  order  escape.  skill  Boyle   director,   acting ability  James Franco   hero, combine  make  film  exciting  nail-biting   story can    already know  outcome.It must    ordeal  figure    make  90-minute film  one man stuck  one place   five days.

127 Hours,630,Johnny Hollywood,11/Feb/11,9,6.388619445602206e-12,film movie one not story good will well even films time best can way life love make just director great two only see made performance though cast without many real family human sense feel year picture take get audience really screen plot,0.0,2.0,inf,inf,inf," The phrase 'remarkably true story' gets thrown around a lot these days. Sure, some of the greatest films of all time are shaped by actual events (see: Goodfellas, Dog Day Afternoon and Cool Runnings), as are a handful of contemporary Best Picture hopefuls in The King's Speech, The Social Network and 127 Hours. But the latter is perhaps the only one that really has the ability to connect with the viewer on such an emotional level. This film presents to us an amazing story of survival and human will in the face of certain death, expertly delivered by director Danny Boyle and Best Actor nominee James Franco.I make the point to not divulge too many plot details in my reviews, but I feel an exception can be made in this case, since the story is so well known. Aron Ralston is a mountain climber intent on journeying through the treacherous Blue John Canyon in Utah. He meets two girls along the way, but continues on his own. He slips while climbing down a narrow rock face, causing a small avalanche in which a boulder traps him between, literally, a rock and a hard place. With his food and water supply running low, and his hallucinations becoming more intense, Aron realises the only way to free himself is to hack off his own arm, after which he ventures out of the canyon and is rescued just before bleeding to death.Danny Boyle is a director with great skill in exposing his audience to the very ends of the Earth. Be it the gloomy backstreets of Trainspotting, or the vibrant Indian flavour of Slumdog Millionaire, he always ensures the setting dosen't just fulfil its role, but stands out as a piece of art. 127 Hours is no different, as vast, sweeping views of the desert and Steadycam shots inside the labyrinth that is Blue John Canyon contribute handsomely to a foreboding sense of isolation and claustrophobia.In contrast, when Aron becomes trapped underground, it is the editing that takes over the cinematography as the primary means of fleshing out the film. Flashbacks and quick cuts allow the viewer to get inside Aron's mindset at any given point, and I found it an accurate portrayal of how, even in times of crisis and great panic, the mind can wander and emotions can change instantly. A standout scene, and a great example of what I'm trying to explain, occurs when Aron pretends he is a guest on a comedic talk show, jokingly explaining how he is about to die, only minutes after recalling how desperately he wants to see his family. If you ignore the other (very minor) roles played by the rest of his unknown cast, James Franco is the only actor in this movie, and it goes without saying that the film would collapse if his performance lacked conviction. Luckily, he puts immense effort into a screenplay the real Aron Ralston called '99.9% accurate'. His turn is unlikely to earn him Best Actor, but he certainly stamps his authority on his own film more than any other nominees do in their respective films. Of course, I couldn't review 127 Hours without giving my opinion on 'that' scene, which is alluded to in the beginning with some excellent use of foreshadowing, by the way. Is it gruesome? I wouldn't dispute that. It is glorified, existing only to disgust? Absolutely not. I couldn't take my eyes of the screen, only because I was keen to see for myself the amount of realism injected into such an intense moment. And believe me, it is intense. Personally, not sickening. But if in doubt, I'd say proceed with caution. Ultimately, though, it's best not to dwell on this single scene, but appreciate the entire film addressing the idea that life is not about what is lost through adversity, but what is gained through determination. What a shame that my three favourite films this year have, collectively, slim-to-nil chance of winning the top prize.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

127 Hours,631,Eternality,10/Feb/11,8,3.60948887141408e-10,film one not story will well even films time can much just makes director still look new only heart made also documentary many humor human character feel take get better works cinema far long right plot,0.0,2.0,inf,inf,inf," **Warning: Huge spoilers ahead as I will write about the film's ending.With a plot this minimalistic, one could forgive director Danny Boyle if he had made a ten-minute short instead of a ninety-minute feature length film about a guy who went hitchhiking and got his right arm crushed in between a rock wall and a huge boulder deep in a crevice of a remote canyon. Based on an incredible true story, 127 Hours is a visual recount of the ordeal an immobile Aron Ralston went through for five days__before he decided to cut off his entire arm with a cheap penknife and escape to freedom.James Franco plays Ralston in a mostly one-man show that exhibits wit, self-depreciating humor, determination, and the will to survive. To his credit, Franco manages to pull everything off quite remarkably despite being stuck in one spot for nearly the entire film. Much like Ryan Renolds in Buried (2010), a claustrophobic horror film about one man's predicament of being buried alive in a coffin, Franco's character earns our sympathy not because his situation is extremely dire, but because he is unlucky to land in such a predicament that is of no fault of his.He has a camcorder with him, and Boyle uses this device of his to design sequences that add much needed humor and the occasional (false) optimism to the film to positively weaken the seriousness of the film's subject matter. There is only a limited number of angles a director can choose to shoot such a film, but Boyle's trademark hyperkinetic visual style allows him to venture into areas that are uncommon even in mainstream cinema, let alone in films of this strange new sub-genre __ for instance, the exaggerated psychology of the protagonist, and the visual-aural parallelization of certain actions in the climax of the film.Boyle explores the mental state of Ralston through sequences of dreams, nightmares, and premonitions __ scenes that would be more at home in a fantasy or horror film, but surprisingly works well in a realist film like 127 Hours. Of course, the overwhelming use of such ""mentalistic"" material (and Boyle does indulge in one too many) makes the film more lively and engaging, but at the expense of emotional depth, which the film somewhat lacks. Yes, we feel Ralston's physical pain, and take pride at his eventual triumph, but the motivation of his to decide to cut his arm off is not as clearly fleshed out as it should.The film's editing creates visual energy with the use of multiple split- screens and quick cuts. And just as well, for I doubt anyone would take pleasure at seeing a long take of Ralston slowly slicing his arm off. Still, that amputation sequence is as graphic as it can get, so those with a weak heart would be advised to look away. Boyle reduces (or for some, increases) the intensity of the sequence through the visual-aural parallelization that I mentioned earlier. For example, he marries the breaking of the human bone to the sound of a gunshot (""bam!""), and the touching of a nerve to the sharp plucking of a string of an electric guitar (""twang!"").127 Hours, for better or worse, is unmistakably a Boyle film __ energetic, rhythmic, and visually creative, but it also comes with its fair share of excess baggage that like a sponge absorbs much of the film's potential emotional power. I sincerely believe Boyle has taken the material as far as he possibly could, and I applaud him for taking the road less travelled. At the same time, I also wonder what could have been if Werner Herzog stumbled upon Ralston's story and made a powerful, provocative documentary instead.

The first time, I cried multiple times. This time, I cried even harder. And it's not even your typical crying-movie.Aron Ralston was stupid enough not to tell anyone about his whereabouts when going to the Blue John canyons. He gets trapped by a boulder and his 127 hours of hell begin. He remembers his friends and family and the two girls he met before he was trapped. Can he make it out? Of course he will and we all know it, we know the story. And this film isn't about it. It's not about getting out of there, it's about the hours spent there and how he got out and what happened in those 127 hours.James Franco gives the performance of his life. He has always been good, but now he has achieved something every actor hopes to achieve - greatness. His portrait of Ralston is so vivid and realistic that it made me cry. I walked in the theater expecting some heart-breaking scenes of him crying and sobbing and promising to the camera to be a better man with piano music in the background. Instead I was given a realistic portrait of a man trapped and needing to get out and trying to do everything he can think of to keep his spirit up and his heart beating. Absolutely beautiful.Danny Boyle is an excellent director as well, he knows how to work his camera and create the feeling of being trapped, even though you never get trapped as the viewer, the camera-work is that good. It wasn't the story, but the camera-work and James Franco's performance that made me cry.I loved the use of split-screen, I would have used it a little less but it's still new and fresh. Although it reminded me of CSI:Miami...This is the movie of the year. I know the Best Actor Oscar probably goes to Colin Firth (not a bad thing, the bloke can act!) but I'm still hoping James Franco will get it.

James Franco is truly remarkable, and gives a touching and triumphant performance of a man forced to take survival to the next level. While Tom Hanks had a whole island to explore and grow on, Franco has an arm wedged in-between a rock in a canyon. And he makes the most of it, with the infamous ""amputation"" scene being just as graphic and terrifying as its hyped to be.I also want to praise the ending. I have been recently let down by endings from two other Oscar contenders (Black Swan and Blue Valentine). But this one has a satisfying finish, though no movie ending has ended as emotionally as The King's Speech this year. Kudos to Danny Boyle for bringing Franco's situation to other levels by inserting visions and hyper-hallucinations into the movie.The best acting I saw from Franco was actually a smaller moment. When he's bidding farewell to the two pretty ladies who accompany him on a mini-adventure, they tell him about a party they want him to come to. As they're talking to him about it, he intertwines some ""Umm-hmmms"" and ""uh-huhs"" into the mix. The flat and almost automated way he speaks this dialog is extremely convincing. I have met many a guy who is sort of rushed in their way of interaction, and so the words he speaks come across muddled but still friendly. Franco also was a character who was sort of a loner in his own respect, and marched to his own drummer. And that comes across so well in Franco's interpretation.This is one of the best films of 2010, and James Franco deserved his best actor Oscar nod. Also the music is uplifting and pat, and the song ""If I Rise"" is beautiful. "," Just saw 127 Hours     spectacular experience!

What I got was an amazing film laced with perseverance, bravery, courage, and sacrifice. This is easily one of my favorite films not only of the year, but of all time.James Franco is the highlight of the movie and delivers a really powerful performance. Franco is able to make a rather arrogant character really likable. Aron Ralston is the cocky, invincible, and adventurous mountain climber type. This attitude makes the character very easy to connect with, and that's one of the most important elements of a movie. You don't need to be a mountain climber or someone who enjoys canyoneering to connect with Ralston. Honestly, I think Ralston successfully embodies the average behavior of a twenty something year old person. Even that if you ever been over confident in your abilities at anything, which I'm sure everyone has in one case or another, then he's very easy to connect with. The entire incident and Ralston's struggle to survive can be a metaphor to any seemingly impossible challenge that anyone faces. Ralston's ability to realize sacrifice is the only way to survive brings a lot of depth to his character and fleshes him out as the protagonist of the film. His arc in the movie is also an amazing treat to behold. As previously stated, he does start out as a very arrogant, ""I can do anything"" kind of person, but his change is executed so well, that he's one of my favorite characters in any movie this year. You can see as the movie progresses that each day really brings a different mood of his character. He starts out extremely angry that things don't seem to go his way, he calms down, realizing that his reason would be key to helping him survive, he starts to work against the problem intelligently, he loses all hope in survival, and then gears up for one last effort at freedom. While this arc is somewhat predictable, the character is so fascinating that it doesn't really matter. Given that the movie only really has five or six characters that actually talk, there's no real need to talk about the supporting cast. This movie is centered around Aron Ralston and his struggle, physical and internal. The movie is an hour and a half of Franco's face, so it's good that the character is amazing.An arrogant climber's arm gets pinned against a canyon wall by a large rock and he must fight for survival with no one to help him. There's the story. The movie's strength in it's plot is the execution of the different ways that Ralston uses to survive and the hallucinations he experiences while starving and being dehydrated. The movie goes from Ralston successfully creating a pulley so that he can stay upright and not fall over while sleeping to him drinking his own urine when he ran out of water. When you mix together a likable character that you feel sympathy toward with successful and last resort ways to survive, you get emotion from the audience accordingly, which is once again extremely important. The viewer wants Ralston to succeed and roots for him against opposition. His hallucinations and memories only add more depth to the character and are very similar to how anyone, well at least me, would likely respond to this type of situation; you wouldn't be caught up thinking about your job or how much work you would need to catch up on, you would be concerned with the people you love and are close to. This adds more reality to the movie and makes for an enjoyable film. When all seemed lost and he was on the brink of death, one final effort is made to escape his impending doom, and he succeeds. If you don't already know the story, he must cut his own arm off. This is the most brutal part of the movie, and it's not easy to watch. But why is that? Often times when watching a violent movie and something graphic happens, it's not anything that people faint over, even if it's more graphic then the amputation in 127 Hours. Why do people faint then when watching this scene? The answer is simple and it shows the expert acting and writing of the character. Generally in those other movies, graphic things happen to minor characters, not usually the protagonist. Since Ralston is such a likable and well made character and we've been with him the whole film through the many trials he had to endure, we hate seeing him in excruciating pain. Generally when you see a friend in pain, it saddens you and you get emotionally involved in their conflict. That's the situation in 127 Hours, plain and simple. I also recommend that you watch the amputation scene for two reason: it helps you feel his pain and it makes the ending that much more satisfying to watch. The scene is brutal, but not unbearable and it's worth watching. The ending of the movie is the best payoff you could expect, just like his situation. If you can bear through the amputation, then the ending can bring you to tears. There are many great scenes in the movie, one in particular, and it's a treat to see them for yourself in this powerful movie.At the end of the film, you will feel so good about yourself. This is the kind of film you watch whenever you feel like you can't overcome a task because you know that you probably won't have to go through anymore suffering than Ralston. I could praise more things about the movie, like the amazing cinematography, background score, direction, and editing, but the central part of the movie is Ralston, and that's plenty enough reason to watch this gem of a movie.

The answer, my friends, is Danny Boyle. Boyle transformed Aron Ralston's true story of survival into the most encapsulating film of the year (so far).Aron Ralson is a climber who must save himself after falling down a pit. His arm stuck by an enormous boulder. He is stuck there for 127 hours, as the title of the films suggests. '127 Hours' would still be a great film if it wasn't a true story. However, the fact that it is based on true events made this even more of a compelling event. Ralston is played by James Franco, known primarily for his role in 'Spiderman'. Franco was perfect for the role. He was tested as he had to show Ralson's sense of humour in a very dark light. Franco had me laughing when he was videoing himself comically whilst stuck in the canyon, yet he had me on the edge of my seat as he amputated his own arm!The cinematography of the film was sublime. Set in an arid canyon in Utah, this was the perfect setting to shoot. Boyle shot from very many angles and distances, creating a pictures on the screen that simply 'blew me away'. The landscape featured was beautifully red in colour.I was kept in suspense from the moment Aron Ralson was trapped under the rock until the moment he freed himself. The amateur climber used very clever survival techniques which I admired greatly. Due to his fatigue, Aron hallucinated about both his current situation stuck under the rock and about his life at home. These hallucinations gave Danny Boyle the perfect opportunity to show off his filmmaking skills. The most potent image is that of Ralson as a child, sitting on his sofa in the middle of a cave: a depiction of the child within us all.The soundtrack by A.R. Rahman complimented the imagery spectacularly. This film is completely different to any other film I have seen. This film is a triumph for Danny Boyle as a director, having to live up to 'Slumdog Millionaire'. '127 Hours' is nominated for the BAFTA for best film which is no surprise to me. A remarkable story shown with exceptional detail! ","   first heard  Danny Boyle's new film '127 Hours',  thought  : ' can  film  made  someone  gets stuck   hole  127 hours?'  answer,  friends,  Danny Boyle.

As much as it attracted criticism for typecasting India, his skills at filmmaking accumulated accolades. Boyle teams up yet again with the Maestro, AR Rahman, screenwriter Simon Beaufoy and producer Christian Colson for '127 Hours'.Shot on location at Utah, it is based on true account by Aron Ralston in his book 'Between a Rock and Hard Place'. The film deal's with the protagonist's ordeal for more than 5 days after a fallen boulder crashed on his arm and trapped him in an isolated canyon. The lack of food and his dwindling water can made it worse. James Franco (Harry Osborne in 'Spiderman') plays Aron Ralston's part to perfection.The movie doesn't dwell on whether Ralston did or didn't do something right. Rather, it is his varying emotions that take the center-stage. Amidst the rocky hopelessness around him, he reminisces his family, draws recollects his last best moments with the passersby he had just met, his thirsty thoughts traveling to the half-filled drink bottle in his car, keeping his spirit alive and finally, garnering the courage to redeem himself.The biggest challenge in a solo film is zero opportunity for dialog. The writers make up for it by interspersing it with recollections, wishful thoughts and self recorded videos. That said '127 Hours' excels at dramatizing the events visually. Cutting between character's point of view and close up of the expressions and then putting in some detailed slow motion shots, the camera work is simply mind blowing. To its credit, its portrayal of events has a 'thumbs up' from the real- life Aron Ralston! But, turning what could have been a great documentary on TV into intense drama on the big-screen marks Danny Boyle's achievement. AR Rahman's ominous music contributes to intensifying the drama. And, its editing has drawn applause too. Goodies apart, '127 Hours' may not be suitable for all audiences. A certain scene (not discussed here) without which the story wouldn't have been complete could be termed 'gory'. But if you think you can stomach it, this flick is not to be missed!

The trailer did mislead really as it made it look like similar movie buried. The difference was the actor no offence to Ryan Reynolds who is amazing James Franco was spot on with his portrayal.The Story as everyone knows is of Hiker __ going out into the desert and cliff by himself and getting trapped by a rock and left for 127 hours to survive until the inevitable choice__ do I cut my arm off to get free.The film made on a she string budget by genius Danny Boyle (28 days later) made this film not to shock which it did, people passing out in cinema but to make people think what they would, wait an die of starvation or cut your arm off and wait for someone to come 5 seconds later and it to be for nothing? That's the overriding question that has to be asked really.James Franco who I have seen little of in a serious acting role i.e. Spiderman which I couldn't stand and the wonderfully underrated pineapple express which he played against character really. But within this you could see he had worked on trying to get the right balance between desperation and over acting and he did with a twist of insanity when has talking to himself very funny.The awards season always does bring out these sort of movies 'art house' flicks that love to bore people into the ground and then at the end say bravo mentioning no names 'hurt locker' but this was made for a wider public to see it was made to be marketed as a film you just had to see. This film is not for the easily amused or the easily distracted it is for the ones who as my brother would say live within each movie they watch and feel what the character feels.This Film does have Barlington's seal of recommendation!

127 Hours,644,pyrocitor,31/Jan/11,10,2.7571332691891417e-08,film movie one comedy well even films time best make just work director drama never two only also performance many sense character year picture audience worth cinema far moments,0.0,2.0,inf,inf,inf," A film involving its protagonist being stuck in a stationary, claustrophobic environment for the majority of its running time would hardly seem a likely candidate for one of the most kinetic and vibrant films of the year, yet the fact that 127 Hours masters such a contradiction proves testament to the nearly peerless abilities of director Danny Boyle. Working with yet another unorthodox premise, Boyle adapts the episode of Aron Ralston's unforgettable canyoning accident and captivity, and somehow, skirting potential obstacles with subject matter (how to work such a visually stagnant premise cinematically) and audience controversy (early reports of hospitalizations in reaction to the unflinchingly graphic climax) to emerge with yet another unexpectedly triumphant and inspiring cinematic triumph.What is truly impressive is the sense of Boyle contemplating and discarding every potential attempt to work shortcuts with his subject matter, allowing himself to cut away from Ralston's rock-bound captivity with flashbacks and hallucinogenic interludes, but only to a tasteful extent, mirroring Ralston's stream of consciousness while never shying away from the sheer numbing and eroding devastation of being trapped in a solitary, claustrophobic environment for such a duration (the film's title, rather than catchy and gratuitous, feels painfully well chosen upon retrospect). Similarly, Boyle adamantly refuses to bank on the film's two main 'set pieces' - Ralston's being trapped by the rock, and eventually freeing himself - structurally or cinematically (despite a gleeful poke at expectations as Ralston scrabbles for, but neglects to bring, his swiss army knife on his expedition). Rather than Ralston's being trapped being subjected to the expected, clich Ãd, slow motion, horrified hush, Boyle delivers it as an offhand, abrupt surprise, Ralston himself seemingly taking minutes to make sense of his predicament. In this vein, there remains an emphasis on immediacy and authenticity of experience throughout, before, during and after Ralston's entrapment, with minuscule, throwaway details such as Ralston's methodical laying the contents of his backpack in front of him to best strategize an escape proving just as poignant as anticipated scenes of screaming and sobbing. However, the true shock is, for a picture with such an ominous reputation, just how ultimately rewarding and frequently enjoyable a watch Boyle's film is, capturing moments of humour (sometimes uncomfortable, sometimes side-splitting) throughout and, in spite of itself, gearing up for an enormously inspiring and uplifting finale. While any other director would likely have succumbed to the temptation of drinking in the gruesomeness of Ralston's escape like a horror movie, Boyle instead frames it within a context of such engrossing introspection, contemplation and decisive stoicism that the graphic footage itself feels, rather than a disturbing money shot, almost besides the point, a mere means to an end in a buildup of overpowering affirmation and propulsion. As wrenching, gruesome and entirely consuming as the film is, the viewer is far more likely to leave the cinema feeling destroyed but cathartically cleansed as traumatized. Similarly, for a film involving extreme claustrophobia, Boyle's film dances with freedom and levity technically, as DP Anthony Dod Mantle's cameras careen around with wild abandon, exploding out of Ralston's tight space to exquisite, expansive extreme wide-angles of the surrounding canyon before plunging back in, and composer A.R. Rahman's musical score bubbles and flits with verve and more solemn reflection. If there is any fault to be found in the film, it lies in Boyle's arguable overstatement of the film's key message, that Ralston finds his predicament ultimately attributable only to his own cockiness and carelessness (the film's explosive beginning captures Ralston in a hyperactive split-screen, juxtaposing him against footage of crowds as if taking excessive pains to stress the alienation soon to come), but even this proves largely excusable if only for the sake of quieting potential banal complaints reducing the film to gratuitous violence. To say that James Franco's performance is career defining would be an understatement, as he wrestles the difficulties of carrying an entire picture while also in a stationary environment with staggering, understated ease. Franco musters such incredible energy in the early sequences of his bustling about like an over-caffeinated surfer that to watch his slow transition into hysterics, self-reevaluation and stubborn resourcefulness proves all the more crushing yet endearingly powerful as result (a sequence of Ralston grilling himself in the style of a talk show interview as to the culpability of his accident epitomizes Franco's incredible gift for charisma, comedy and understated drama simultaneously). While far too naturalistic and un-showy to warrant many (very deserving) award chances, suffice to say that Franco's performance deserves any quantity of accolades and praise.Fuelled by incredible energy, power, and sheer wrenching emotional impact, Boyle's 127 Hours proves a work of staggering innovation and genius whether taken as character study or circumstantial thematic meditation. Horrifying yet deeply uplifting in a single breath and bursting with consummate technical and dramatic skill, Boyle's latest proves yet another unforgettable masterpiece of realism and cinematic dazzle, worth undertaking for all capable of sidestepping squeamishness - the triumphant result is well worth it.-9.5/10 ","  film involving  protagonist  stuck   stationary, claustrophobic environment   majority   running time  hardly seem  likely candidate  one    kinetic  vibrant films   year,   fact  127 Hours masters   contradiction proves testament   nearly peerless abilities  director Danny Boyle.

Mercifully, since we really know what's to come before our butt hits the comfortable seat __ I'm sure he'd give his right arm to sit down during those 5 days __ ouch, sorry __ its good we don't have to endure much more than an hour and a half.That's not to take away from his pain. But, quite literally, the events that took place, the background and surroundings, didn't really need much more time. Boyle did just fine with what took place.Simply speaking, avid and arrogant outdoorsman Aron treks alone in the Utah canyons after meeting two out-of-nowhere pretty girls. They invite him to a Scooby of a party that night after he shows them a ""wet"" time. I'm guessing this might have inflated his ego even more, if possible, and he takes an ill-fated risk causing a bolder to lodge between a canyon wall and his poor right arm.Unfortunately for him, no one's within shouting distance and all first attempts at freeing himself are futile. What follows (for what we know are hours, then days) are his textbook emotions __ SEE: Open Water. And that's not discounting what he went through, nor is it saying any of its fake on what occurred during his imprisonment. For, unlike The Perfect Storm, Aron video tapes himself down there.Yeah, it's a true story, and I concur he's more of an survivalist than me, but I'd give up one whole paycheck for the batteries he was buying__nothing I own would last as long as his did on battery juice.I digress. Again, Franco did a fantastic job __ pretty much, aside from (potential hallucinations) or flashbacks, he's running the one-man show.Comparatively speaking, the same year produced Buried, another one-man extravaganza about a man trapped in a coffin. Between the two, putting the ""trueness"" of this one aside, I'd pick 127 Hours even without the gruesome ending and self-mutilation he had to endure/cause.Aside from the great cinematography, the quick length and the performance worthy of an Oscar Nod (only) I will say I admire Boyle not turning this into a ""Hero"" type of feel-good movie. The man, Aron, did nothing heroic, he put himself selfishly and incautiously in harm's way and he did what needed to be done to get free. He didn't jump on a speeding train (Unstoppable) to save the children! Or trek to NYC (The Day After Tomorrow) to save freezing children! Or, you get the picture. He fell making a mistake after making a mistake of not telling anyone where he was at. So, he made mistakes, paid dearly and now we get an instructional video of what not to do.The movie's nominated for best picture. Sure, it was good, very well made, even though I did NOT care for the music choices very much. Should it win? Absolutely not. Should it be viewed: hell yes.

Overall, the movie was quite good with its pace, given that it has really one character for most of the movie.The opening and credits are not very clear on their meaning. Though it is not clear how participating in large crowds is related to the matter of the film, apparently, Boyle is attempting to show the ""human"" experience within large crowds.At any rate, James Franco's portrayal of the mountain climber being stuck in a lonely canyon with a boulder wedged across his arm and being unable to get out is very commendable indeed. He displays all the emotions that one would expect to experience when in such a situation. The way he remembers his past experiences with his friends and family is certainly something that many of us have felt to be the only thing that keeps us going when we are faced with loneliness. His performance deserved the Oscar nomination that it got. Whether he will go on to win the coveted award is anybody's guess.In many ways, this movie portrays things that most of us have experienced: the feeling of loneliness that never seems to go away , the feeling of being cramped inside a small space and the feeling that there is a big boulder on top of us that holds us back. When he says ""this boulder has been waiting for me all this time"", it is certainly something that many of us can identify with when we face big obstacles in the course of our daily lives. Under the present social conditions, due to long work hours and lack of free time, not all of us have the opportunity of actually socializing and forming social relations with people outside of work. Hence, this movie can be taken as an allegory to real life conditions that many of us have to go through: we do sometimes have to give an arm or leg to escape from loneliness and form lasting social relations.

After watching this film you will never again take anything in life for granted even the small stuff like food, water, and everything else from sharing time with people will be that much more important to you. This film is also a film of reflection to make one think about mistakes, choices, and it gives one the will and determination to live.Director Danny Boyle who's always at the top of his game always makes pictures that are tough yet usually the human soul and spirit prevails(""Slumdog Millionaire"")this picture even though harrowing and a struggle wins in the end. As it's isolated journey helps you as a viewer appreciate in the end everything about life. Many of the visuals(aside from the bloody arm amputation scene)are wonderfully done as the camera work of angles of the canyons are top notch. And themes of drama, emotion, uncertainty, loss and will to survive make it such a compelling film.Based on a real life true story of hiker and rock climber Aron Ralston(in a career best performance from Jack of all trades James Franco)it's 2003 and Aron an adventure and loner type decides to take a weekend trip to Moab, Utah for some climbing and sight seeing of some beautiful and wonderful canyons. Upon arrival he meets two cute gals Kristi(Kate Mara)and Megan(Amber Tamblyn)and after having a little fun and taking a dip in a nearby lake stream of water, it's back to more canyon climbing for Aron. Only a big fall of uncertainty and isolation takes place with a slip all of a sudden Ralston takes a fall between a narrow canyon and to complicate matters a giant boulder has fallen trapping and pinning him in.From then on the film becomes a journey of self discovery as the flashbacks and scenes of foreshadowing tell Aron a lot about life he thinks about his past and to help keep him alive and for motivation good thoughts and images of family, friends, and intimate thoughts of Kristi and Megan help keep him going another day. As being trapped for five days Aron learns to appreciate much even the small things like air and water. And perhaps god sent are the premonitions of things to come as that only gives him more motivation to live. As being stuck between a rock and a hard place and the fact that no one knows calls for desperate measures in desperate times. The scene is gross and somewhat disturbing it shows just what someone will do just so they can survive.""127 Hours"" is a film that proves never take anything for granted as in an unexpected and unplanned time of survival isolation one can learn to appreciate everything even the small things like water and air.

Franco is basically putting on a one-man show for probably 90% of the running time and he (and director Danny Boyle) manage to keep the story flowing effortlessly, and draw the viewer into the nightmare that Ralston has literally fallen into. Ralston is a rock climber who makes the tragic mistake of going climbing alone without telling anyone where he would be going. A fall into a deep crevice traps his arm against a canyon wall and the movie is the account of Ralston's fight to survive, based on the book that he wrote about this experience. In that sense, there's no real mystery about what the outcome will be - the movie is based on Ralston's own book, and acknowledges that off the top. Obviously he survives. The question is how. Franco brilliantly portrays Ralston's growing desperation (which begins more as frustration as he assumes that he'll find a way out but gradually realizes that getting out is going to be a lot more difficult than he at first thought.) As his food and water run out and as he battles insects and cold nights and comes to terms with his life and some of the mistakes he's made you get drawn into his situation. Even if you've never read the book, you basically know how this situation is going to be resolved but that doesn't take away from the movie's power. In some respects I might compare this to the movies ""Alive"" or ""World Trade Centre"" - each of which deal with somewhat similar circumstances of people trapped in nightmarish situations wondering how they're going to get out. The difference here is the one-man nature of the story.In addition to Franco's performance, the on location filming offers starkly beautiful pictures of the canyon environment. From a strictly personal perspective (and this is merely a matter of taste I suppose) I didn't care for much of the musical score (especially the opening music) and I'm not really a big fan of split screens, which occur periodically throughout this. Overall, though, from the simple perspective of the story (which is, of course, what really counts) I'd say this is a must see.

127 Hours,651,dieBartdie,26/Jan/11,9,6.613449429940202e-14,film movie not story well even time best can way life much make just makes work movies director enough never great two only first made ever real doesnt sense american character feel kind get audience really works far might,0.0,2.0,inf,inf,0.0," 127 Hours is a movie about a guy who got stuck under a rock. And it is excellent! I was skeptical, especially since the premise reminded me of ""Open Water"", which ran out of material after about 30 minutes. 127 Hours does use some trickery in the form of flashbacks and hallucinations, not to mention the overall more optimistic tone. But usually those scenes are short, used effectively and make sense. Even the introduction is of appropriate length and doesn't stall the pace, with the accident happening only a few minutes in. There really is enough happening throughout the movie to keep you at the edge of the seat despite the claustrophobic setting.Aron Ralston, whose real-life story this movie is based on, was heavily involved in the production, which makes this a very authentic representation of his traumatic experiences. ""Based on a true story"" usually doesn't mean much, but here you can feel the natural, almost documentary-style sequence of events, at the same time more absurd and more brutally realistic than any fictional script could ever be. James Franco does an excellent job playing Aron and thus mastering the challenge of being the only protagonist for the vast majority of the movie. His portrayal is Oscar material, no doubt, and clearly the main reason this movie works so well. The beginning of the movie shows Aron's passion for the location the movie takes place in, the vast, beautiful canyons of Utah. He spontaneously plays tour guide for two girls he finds hiking into the wrong direction, shows them beautiful, hidden places and it seems he generally has a great time. The moment he gets caught under a rock comes abrupt. Despite anticipating it from the moment the movie starts, you find yourself in disbelieve, just as the main character. This can't really be. There has to be a way out of this, some way to waggle his body, some lucky coincidence, some magical, saving idea to get free-- but it doesn't happen.And thus, both the main character and the audience have to start thinking those uncomfortable thoughts few other movies force upon the audience-- especially for almost the entire length of the movie. How much water is left in that bottle, what tools are available, how far can your hand reach... or your feet. It's a horrible feeling to not be able to move back and forth, to be stuck within an arm-length radius in the middle of nowhere, hugging an absurdly huge boulder, day and night. Unpredictable problems such as finding a way to sleep in a position where you are constantly hanging backwards become a challenge. Nights are getting cold. Dropping a knife is a matter of life and death. Fighting panic becomes a priority. We dive into Aron's psyche now and then, memories flashing by, nightmares and even hallucinations. He thinks of his parents, mistakes he made in the past. He starts using his video camera to record messages and as a kind of diary. Strangely the techniques to keep a movie interesting seem to be the same the brain uses to keep your mind from drifting into madness in extreme situations. Danny Boyle is a director who never repeats himself, to the point where you could almost criticize his lack of a ""personal style"". Yet somehow, he almost always pulls it off. 127 Hours continues that trend, picking up a very difficult fringe genre and making the very best of it. The fast, colorful, almost MTV-style editing of the introduction seems out of place at first, but eventually makes sense as it brilliantly contrasts the isolation and bleakness of the later movie. You never feel bored as the film constantly captures the gruesome anticipation of the next, inevitable step. Towards the end, the movie gets almost unbearably tense. It forces you to sit through a real, nightmarish situation you might have heard of in the news but always avoided thinking about for more than a minute. And it is an immensely powerful ride. It revives that trite American ideal of ""never giving up"" in a literal way with a story that doesn't leave much room for clich Ãs. This might as well be Danny Boyle's best or at least most daring work so far. A powerful movie that makes you appreciate just being alive.

Looking back over the last decade of winners, it would be safe to say that, with the possible exception of the Coen brothers, every winner has either peaked when they won the award or sometime before it. Slumdog Millionaire might have been his Oscar winner, but Trainspotting had been his calling card for a decade before that, and try as he might, until the his trip to the slums he'd struggled to repeat the composed brilliance of that and his first feature, Shallow Grave. However, another common theme of those award winning directors is their desire and ability to swap between genres and styles as if it was almost compulsory, and in that respect Boyle is no different.So after a sweeping epic with a touchstone of popular culture at its core, Boyle has decided to make a high concept true story. If you don't know by now, Aron Ralston was an experienced and cocky young canyoneer who ventured into the rocky wilderness of Utah in 2003, and didn't feel the need to tell anyone his whereabouts. Several hours later, Ralston came to be stuck at the bottom of a tiny crack in the rocks, miles from civilisation, his right arm pinned by an immovable boulder. Having explored his options, he eventually concludes that the only realistic option for his survival is to cut it off__ If you were unaware of that particular development and are now about to complain strenuously about spoilers, then don't. Rather than the structure of a thriller, the hours counting down like a reverse Jack Bauer marathon, Boyle has fashioned a character piece, albeit one with hallucinations of a giant inflatable Scooby Doo and old girlfriends thrown in. The intention is to put you resolutely in Ralston's shoes, to feel what he feels, and to understand what you'd do in that hopeless position. In much the same way as Ryan Reynolds did in that coffin last year, James Franco gets to prove his acting chops with some varied challenges and acquits himself remarkably well. Which is a relief, for despite odd appearances from Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn as the girls he meets on his way to the cavern, and Cl Ãmency Po Ãsy as the apparitional ex, Franco is the only person on screen for the majority of the run time.Boyle has a kinetic and restless visual style, so doesn't remain pinned down for a second; his visual shorthand seems odd at first, such as shots from the inside of a water bottle, but allows for reams of exposition without requiring a man to spend the best part of ninety minutes talking to himself (water refreshing, water lower, water running out, water__ oh wait, that's not water); Ralston had a video camera and so we do get a little inner monologuing. But what we are doing to a certain extent is killing time until the third act, and it's the structure that is the only real drawback here, our hero (who is not seen as a totally reformed character by his experience, more fortunate to possess the necessary skills to execute the deed) stuck early on and the mere title causing us to keep checking our watches until the clock runs out and__ Right, those of a nervous disposition needn't bother, for at this point Boyle cranks it up to the max, and you will feel every action to your very core. Boyle uses every trick in the book to help you truly understand what a man goes through when he has to remove a decent sized chunk of himself . But for the lopsided structure, this could have been another classic; instead, it's a worth watch and a wonderful tribute to man's endurance, but it just may test your endurance a little before it's all over.Why see it at the cinema: If you want to test your mettle and don't feel up to torture porn, then 127 Hours has all of the gore and the anguish but comes with more character work and added street cred.

Without tell you any further, you can conclude yourself, he would survive after all, right? The golden question will be how did he survive? British Director, Danny Boyle is one of my favorite Directors of all-time, I note he is always good with the number on his movie titles such as ""28 Days Later.."" (2002) and ""Millions"" (2004). After telling an inspiring story in India through ""Slumdog Millionaire"" (2008), he takes us back to the United States. The incident occurred at Blue john Canyon (the Utah desert) where solitary mountaineer Aron Ralston fell into a canyon and being trapped under a boulder. Aron is played by James Franco. The movie starts with an energetic mood and spirit, plus stylish split screen and exhilarating music as well. As long as I remember, Boyle always could make an enjoyable adventure experience with his vigorously music, and thiz time he does it either. James Franco takes on responsibility for his one-man-show very well. My favorite act is when he imitates the host of ""Morning Live Show' and pretends to interview himself. He is very convincing by delivering nail-biting and captivating performances all at once, just like what Ryan Reynold did recently when he was being ""Buried"" (2010). Once again, Boyle shows his capability of capturing human despair by mixing hallucination scenes and flashback sequences. Overall, it was 8 minutes of great music and 1 hour 27 minutes of pure thrills. In the end, I can assure you that Aron's experience is not simple as you think. When you are being trapped like him, it's just okay if you know you are going to survive in 127 hours ahead, maybe you can manage something to get through of that. But the real situation is not that simple, Aron didn't know for how long he would be stuck in there or even whether or not he was going to survive in that moment. Last time, Danny Boyle introduced us the exotic of Phi Phi Leh Island (near Phuket , Thailand) through ""The Beach"" (2000). After that movie, thousands of people crowded that place. Thiz time, Boyle shows us the beauty of Utah Canyon, I 'm pretty sure people will go there as well. Can't wait what place he will take us next time.

After being stuck for five days Ralston used little more than a blunt knife to cut off his arm and escape. This film examines the ordeal as closely as possible, commencing with a montage of Ralston's rapid lifestyle, to when he meets two female hikers and then his drop into the canyon. From this point the film immerses the audience into Ralston's space, rapidly visualising many of his thoughts and his emotions. He remembers his family most fondly and a sense of regret is one of the major fragments of Ralston's personality that emerges from his nightmare. One of the most surprising thrillers of last year was Buried, a minor thriller set entirely inside a wooden coffin. It was an effective exercise in claustrophobia that relied heavily on coincidences. Danny Boyle's 127 Hours, adapted from Ralston's own book ""Between a rock and a Hard place"", is similar in being set almost entirely in one location, with almost a single actor too. Its ambitions are however undeniably more sophisticated. Boyle has been periodically interested in the velocity of the lives of young men. And he uses that as a basis for an intriguing question: how will someone so regularly mobile cope physically and emotionally by no longer being in control of their body? He attempts to answer this through a deliberately hyper-kinetic visual style. At the beginning the thumping beats of music combine with rapid cutting and split screens to project an image of Ralston's lifestyle. He's the sort of guy thrilled to have his heart beating out of his chest. His energy is infectious to others too though. His introduction to two hikers briefly suggests that he has enough charm to still connect with people when he wants to. After some cave diving one of the girls he meets says playfully: ""I don't think we figured into his day"". This is merely the surface of Ralston though as Boyle is intent on taking the audience deeper into the adventurers emotions. Boyle's direction, through some unconventional camera-work by Slumdog cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, is fearless. He gives us point-of- view shots from inside a water bottle so that we can see Ralston's tongue licking out the final drops from inside. He cuts to an imagining of a plentiful Gatorade container and to an extreme close-up of Ralston's face under a cloth. I have rarely warmed to this hyper brand of filmmaking as its long been used by action directors to substitute narrative for momentum. There's more feeling to Boyle's work though: he succeeds in making us feel the limitations and the desperation of this space. He achieves the realisation that every bit of water, every dropped tool and each catch of sunlight is crucial for survival. It's a credit to Boyle and Franco that the film pulls off most of its gambles. There's a lighter scene where Ralston verbally interviews himself, like on a talk show, complete with canned laughter. It's a surprisingly funny moment but Franco's internalisation of his longing and regret is particularly notable. Ironically, the film's most touching moment is also it's most restrained. Franco is given the appropriate amount of time and space to bring genuine sincerity to Ralston as he speaks into a video camera, apologising to his parents. I found that to be the film at its most poignant. Inevitably, there are some missteps with this unorthodox brand of storytelling. The flashbacks to the family are mostly touching but they also veer dangerously close to sentimentality too. There's a slightly cringing moments where Aron remembers his sister playing the piano with him and he hazily says under his rock: ""Way-to-go sis"". There's also the strange recurrence of a child that is certainly not Aron's and not himself but perhaps an imagining of his own future son. Most crucial though is the absentee of the aftermath. We learn that Ralston married after three years and continued with his sports but surely there were darker and more isolating aftershocks to come. Not even the fearless Danny Boyle can take us there.

127 Hours,656,Aaron Noonan,18/Jan/11,8,7.656830427737162e-14,film movie one not good will well time best can much make just may movies little drama never see heart made performance people something tale doesnt character feel kind action get better really screen seen right dont,0.0,2.0,inf,inf,inf," 127 Hours tells the famous tale of Aron Ralston, a charismatic mountain climber and general sport enthusiast, who through a series of ill fated decisions became trapped in Blue John Canyon in Utah, in mid 2003. His arm had been crushed and lodged between a boulder and a canyon, effectively imprisoning him. He told nobody where he was going. Literally nobody. The movie details the 127 Hours that he is stuck there - his efforts to survive with what little rations he had, the psychological impact of his entrapment, and of course as I'm sure everyone knows at this stage, his escape.This is a very very good movie, and is well worthy of the accolades that it will undoubtedly receive. It does seem on paper as an extremely difficult, if not impossible movie to make, given that most of the screen time is dedicated to Ralston, played by James Franco, sitting in what is essentially his tomb. However, Danny Boyle, through fantastic writing with Simon Beaufoy, and slightly less than fantastic directing has delivered a ninety four minute film that simply does not get boring.Indubitably, James Franco is the star of the show here. He owns the role he plays. I truly believed in him as Aron Ralston, which is a rare thing in a movie, particularly a biopic. At no point in the film does his performance feel laboured, despite the fact that for much of the movie, it is just you and Franco one on one, with nothing to distract you from his performance. From the extreme highs, to the extreme lows in Ralston's five days you really feel like you're with him. His incessant cockiness never alienates you from his character, if nothing else it serves to bring you closer to the character, to root for him in his time of demise. If this was any other actor, I feel the opposite may be true. For someone so charismatic and free-spirited, this is the ultimate torture. Colin Firth was fantastic in The King's Speech, but James Franco is better. I do feel Franco owes much of his performance to Beaufoy/Boyle's writing, but that can be said vice versa too. It just works.Given all of this, I do feel the direction of the movie left something to be desired. I haven't seen Slumdog Millionaire, or indeed any of Danny Boyle's other movies, but I wasn't a lover of how he made this movie. Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to say he was horribly awful or anything of the sort, but I got the distinct impression that Boyle got spooked at the idea of filming Franco in a canyon for over an hour and felt the need to add in plenty and plenty of special effects to keep the viewer entertained. For me, this was a foolish move. The tri-split screen thing, the irrelevant cheering crowds, the in your face action at the start, kind of bothered me, particularly as the movie pushed on. It's my opinion that the film could have been better had it relied solely on Franco's performance, had Boyle had more faith in it maybe, if the movie was more purely a dramatic piece. Maybe I'm just picky. It didn't stop me loving it too much.The now infamous arm scene towards the end, well, it doesn't deserve half the discussion it's getting. In fact none of it. It's a bit bloody, and in the context of the movie it's heart wrenching, but from what I'm reading and hearing it's becoming the selling point of the movie. People are going to see, or indeed not going to see 127 Hours due to how realistic the scene is. It is a fantastic scene. Fantastic fantastic fantastic. I just hope hope hope it doesn't undermine Franco's performance. Go see this movie if you like a good drama. That's what it is, and it's up there with the best of them because it's one that drags you down and pulls you right back up a dozen times over. James Franco truly blew me away and if he doesn't get the Oscar for Best Actor I will eat my hat and various other items of clothing.

Basically the entire movie is James Franco (hardly moving) alone, with a rock smashed on his right arm. He has hallucinations, and a (fake) little radio show moment (shot through his digital camera) and a small amount of tools to figure out a way to survive. Watching him look into the camera and talk about how sorry he is for not calling his mom back, and how he won't make it to his sister's wedding is heart wrenching. Annnnd this is a true story. Having said that, it is also one of the most well-acted one man movies I've seen since Castaway. No wonder the academy loves Mr. Franco.Best Scenes: 1. The beginning when he meets two girls hiking the trail he's hiking. 2. All the digital camera scenes. 3. The ending (If your queasy you might want to look away)It's Not An Action Movie: So if you came to see one...go see Tron instead. This is a suspenseful character study and a journey into the life (and mind) of someone who went through a horrific experience. Believe me when I say it's pretty much a one-man movie. Also believe me when I say you shouldn't pass it up.Best Line: Aron: ""You know, I've been thinking. Everything is... just comes together. It's me. I chose this. I chose all this. This rock... this rock has been waiting for me my entire life. It's entire life, ever since it was a bit of meteorite a million, billion years ago. In space. It's been waiting, to come here. Right, right here. I've been moving towards it my entire life. The minute I was born, every breath that I've taken, every action has been leading me to this crack on the out surface.""Hello Danny Boyle: If you're a fan of his work, you will surely not be disappointed with this movie. He directed and co-wrote the screenplay for this movie and it is gooooooooood. Also if you are a nerd like me, you'll know who A.R. Rahman is (the guy behind Slumdog Millionaire's music) and you'll know he did the music for this movie as well. It's very good and....oh hey wait....oh hayyyy Dido!

The film starts off with Ralston planning a huge trip through Canyonlands National Park in Utah. At the beginning of his journey, Aron meets up with Kristi and Megan, who are also looking for some adventure. Aron and the girls share a fun filled day together full of swimming and some hiking. By nightfall, Megan and Kristi part ways and invite Aron to come to a party a few days away. Aron says, he will see if he can make it and that's where the real adventure begins. Aron, now alone ventures deep into the Canyonlands where he falls into an isolated canyon only to find his arm trapped by a boulder. What happens for the next hour and 30 minutes is the remarkable true tale of one man doing anything he can to save himself. An intense film ensues...First and foremost, ""127 Hours"" is based on a true story of Aron Ralston. The film itself is based on his autobiography ""Between A Rock and Hard Place""and the story is nothing short of fascinating. As far as the movie goes, Danny Boyle really makes ""127 Hours,"" a unique and intensive movie going experience, which I give him a huge amount of credit for. As a film lover, I realize that a film about a guy stuck in a canyon for 93 minutes isn't an easy sell nor would many think it would make for an intense and exciting movie.Boyle using his directing and writing skills makes ""127 Hours"" probably one of the most intense films I have seen in years. I love how Boyle made the beginning of the film feel all upbeat and lighthearted. While I was watching this film with my fianc Ãe it was funny because in the first five minutes of the film we looked at each other and said ""what is this?"" It seemed like a nice little film about this adventurous guy who meets up with two women and goes on adventures with them. The film sets its audience up for the unexpected. You think your getting a feel good film but after the first 10 minutes you are just glued to the edge of your seat in suspense.As I said above, about 10 minutes in, Aron falls down the hole and I thought to myself ""oh great this is going to be so boring now because all now he is stuck in a hole. The reason I thought this is because of previous films, which feature people being stuck and how dull they were to watch. One film I instantly thought of was ""World Trade Center"" directed by Oliver Stone. That film was so long and boring that after a while the audience just didn't care. With this film, Boyle made it interesting because not only did he use flashbacks but he also showed the thoughts running through Aron's mind. The way Boyle does this perfect because he doesn't overuse any of the resources he has. It does a good mix between the actual situation, flashbacks, and visions, which help make this film more intense than any horror film I have seen in recent years.The movie would not be nearly as good without Franco in the lead. Franco is an interesting actor because he started off playing very random roles but then got popular in comedies. Now, Franco seems to go back and forth with comedy and drama. I think this role was perfect for him. Franco fits the look, the build, and even the personality for the film. I didn't think I would ever say Franco deserves an Oscar but he just might for this film. I think a lot of that goes into the solid story and direction of Boyle but it also proves to me at least that Franco has a lot of talent and has what it takes to be a big star.""127 Hours"" proves to me that a good simple story can go a long way with the right people taking on the material. This film is a remarkable and intense film that leaves you as an audience member just sitting on the edge of your seat wondering whats going to happen next. We all heard about the end scene and it's probably one of the most disgusting scenes I have ever seen. I think this scene is so hard to watch because of how real the film is. This isn't a special effects film, it's not about some weird killer, or anything else far-fetched and overused. This is a real story about real people. As I said in the beginning of this review, this movie isn't an easy sell but Boyle turns it into an emotional, edge of your seat film that surely won't disappoint. It takes a talented director, writer and cast (even though small) to make a film like ""127 Hours"" work and this is one film everyone involved should be very proud of.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""127 Hours"" is a solid 9 out of 10. It definitely ranks up there as one of the best films of 2010 and is definitely the most intense!

It reminded viewers of the one graphic scene that had caused viewers to feel sick and almost faint. And then I realized what I had actually signed up to see, how every single shot in the film would hint at his entrapment and his eventual escape. I was sweaty and scared during shots at the beginning in which James Franco simply ran his hands across smooth rocks. That is effective filmmaking. But from now on, I don't think I'll mention the arm thing, which was harrowing, but I think Danny Boyle didn't want to make it the focus of the entire film.Here's why. There's a framing device used, shots of people on a crowded train platform, fans in a packed stadium, cars on a highway, all emphasizing the multitude of people everywhere else, except for where Aron Ralston was trapped. We get the sense that he wanted to be alone, and while I haven't read the book he wrote, I'm going to assume that this is something he had written about extensively. This is about as much as we get in terms of character development...and really about as much as we can expect, and as a result, a lot of the flashbacks revolve around his experiences with an ex-girlfriend, which allow us to escape the ridiculously claustrophobic conditions in the canyon, and also shows us what would prompt a person to go somewhere so lonely without letting anyone know where he was going.This makes the people helping Aron in the end seem like they're functioning symbolically as well. He needs people to survive. He has learned his lesson. It's no longer just a factual account, and I respect the desire to incorporate a small arc, or a small emotional change into such a big, terrifying, and life-altering experience.But did it work? Kind of. It was visceral. It made me at first want to get away from the crowds and the noise, and then it made me want to go right back, to never be alone.And all of it, really, was pretty (odd thing to say for something so gruesome). A combination of the colors from Slumdog Millionaire and the movement and effects from 28 Days Later.Dare we say that Danny Boyle is an auteur? And can we watch anything he makes without thinking of his big smiling face at the Oscars?For more film reviews, see my blog: http://girlnotbeast.blogspot.com/ ","  knew James Franco's character  going  cut  arm ,   wasn't seriously worried    walking   ramp  theater #7   noticed  small white sign taped   wall.  reminded viewers   one graphic scene   caused viewers  feel sick  almost faint.    realized    actually signed   see,   single shot   film  hint   entrapment   eventual escape.   sweaty  scared  shots   beginning   James Franco simply ran  hands  smooth rocks.   effective filmmaking.   now ,  don't think  mention  arm thing,   harrowing,   think Danny Boyle didn't want  make   focus   entire film.Here's .   framing device used, shots  people   crowded train platform, fans   packed stadium, cars   highway,  emphasizing  multitude  people everywhere else,    Aron Ralston  trapped.  get  sense   wanted   alone,    haven't read  book  wrote,  going  assume    something   written  extensively.     much   get  terms  character development... really   much   can expect,    result,  lot   flashbacks revolve   experiences   ex-girlfriend,  allow us  escape  ridiculously claustrophobic conditions   canyon,  also shows us   prompt  person  go somewhere  lonely without letting anyone know    going.This makes  people helping Aron   end seem   functioning symbolically  well.  needs people  survive.   learned  lesson.  no longer just  factual account,   respect  desire  incorporate  small arc,   small emotional change    big, terrifying,  life-altering experience.But   work?

With flashy images and colors, Danny Boyle's style is showing up more in his films. 127 Hours is about a guy cutting off his arm. That is the plot, basic and simple. Aron Ralston is a hardcore biker who loves to climb and one day, just as you predicts, he got trapped. Being stuck in between a rock for 5 days with limited food, little water, no heat, and no restroom can really change a person's point of view. Seeing how he survives the five days feels like I'm watching a camping film. But 127 Hours is more than that, it has this hidden feeling that you feel bad for this guy. With his charming personality, James Franco was able to portray Aron Ralston accurately. This guy was really funny throughout the film even though he had to cut off his own hand. But whenever the movie focuses on how Aron survives, it becomes a movie about survival.

If you've ever seen any of the real footage Aron Ralston shot when he was actually trapped, it's impressive how Boyle recreates it but takes us inside the mind of a man who rationally looks at this situation and tries to keep hold of that matter-of-factness while slowly losing his mind. It's a superior feat by someone who is becoming one of our greatest directors (rather than simply a stylist), and the work James Franco contributes by transferring Ralston's epiphany and physical ordeal to the screen is equally amazing.Most anyone will know what happens before they see the film.

Spoilers are strictly avoided in my comments on movies. I completely understand that not everyone rushes out to see new releases the way that I do. For this movie, there can be no spoilers. We are all painfully aware of the real life ordeal suffered by Aron Ralston in 2003. This taut film succeeds at bringing to life the visuals our minds can only imagine.Danny Boyle is a terrific director and has three (now four) outstanding and diverse movies to his name (Slumdog Millionaire, Millions, Trainspotting). Here he re-teams with Slumdog writer Simon Beaufoy to bring us the screen version of Aron Ralston's book ""Between a Rock and Hard Place"". It's the story of an adventurous young man who is forced to take drastic measures when his arm is pinned after a fall while rock climbing.What the film really explores is Ralston's personality. A cocky, adventurous, fun-loving guy whose ""oops"" moment consisted of not telling anyone where he was headed. A cardinal sin for hikers. Five days later he stumbles back to life, minus one arm. Ralston faces one of those moments when he must decide just how important life is. He must be a courageous man because his choice leads to life ... through excruciating pain.Boyle does an amazing job in capturing the moment and the setting. In what could be a hopeless situation, Ralston clings to life. James Franco delivers an Oscar worthy performance as Ralston. His range here is remarkable. Watching his hallucinations, flashbacks and persistence makes this an extremely watchable film despite the topic.Support work is minimal but decent from Kate Mara, Amber Tamblyn, Treat Williams, Kate Burton and Clemence Poesy. Franco and Boyle are the real stars as they capture Ralston's spirit. As a viewer, this taps into our inner most fear. What if this were us? What if we were him? Could we do it? Would we do it?

Through a pretty serious event of misfortune, he gets trapped in a canyon by a boulder that pulverises his arm against the canyon wall; literally between a rock and a hard place. And, the desperate measures he resorts to in order to free himself. From a Hollywood perspective, this sounds like it could be turned into a wildly spectacular action film with a bold, heroic protagonist, hysterical relatives and ""Where is my son? PLEASE FIND MY SON!!"" *intense sobbing* - type of dialogue. Yes? No. Boy, am I glad this was directed by Danny Boyle... The man we all know for his raw, authentic film style. Instead of aforementioned blockbuster drama, he opted for an incredibly realistic, documentary-like film. 127 Hours starts off with no form of introduction whatsoever. We do not get to 'meet' Aron or any of his relatives. However, any such introduction quickly proves to be redundant as, over the fast-paced opening credits, we see Aron enthusiastically preparing for and taking off on a hiking trip (ignoring his mother's phone call in the process...), and there you have it: this is a 'too cool for school', overconfident adrenaline junkie, and that's all we need to know. This overconfidence gradually proves to be the source of pretty much all his problems, as it is later on revealed that Aron neglected to tell anyone where he was going... Oops.Like I said, this film looks and feels very much like a documentary, like National Geographic made a big budget reconstruction of the event. The film makers' choice to cast James Franco was a very good one. He is simply amazing. Mind you __ he is alone in this film for about 95% of the time. This requires an actor with the guts and skill to carry an entire film, and I must admit, Franco probably wouldn't have been my first choice. But __ to my pleasant surprise __ he pulls it off, and is actually very worthy indeed of his Oscar nomination. He displays an impressively wide range of emotions, all equally convincing. Panic, disbelief, despair, delusion, hurt and hallucinations. But even confidence, coolness, exhilaration and rationality; it's all there. Aron Ralston, as a character, starts off as a seemingly quite cocky, confident, care-free dude who just wants to enjoy himself and do what he loves most: exploring nature. Without telling his family. But as the film progresses, and Aron realises just what kind of mess he's in, you can slowly see a change occurring in him. And the fact that, after a while you greatly start to sympathize with him and even admire him, despite his obvious stupidity before, is all due to James Franco. He has really proved himself to be a very fine character actor with the capability of moving his audience. There is one scene in particular which I found really captivating. During the 'Tuesday' scene, Aron records himself on his camcorder, acting like he's on a talk show, answering his own questions. This scene is top-notch, acting wise, and this is where you really start to feel for him. Throughout Aron's ordeal, we are shown various flashbacks of his childhood, friends, family and loves. This might seem like a clich Ã, but honestly, what else are you supposed to think about when you're stuck in a canyon for five days? Some people on the boards and in other reviews have said they think Aron to be a superficial person for not having some kind of spiritual enlightenment while he was trapped, but I just want to voice my own personal opinion on that matter. Honestly, I don't think it's anybody's business to judge what Aron thought and felt throughout his ordeal. We all deal with hardship in our own personal way, and talking to God is not necessarily an option for everyone. Some of us simply draw support from family and love and good memories. I know that's what I'd do. Now, back to technical talk. The sense of realism of 127 Hours comes greatly from the grainy, unsteady camera work and graphic depiction of everything. Which is a note that comes with a warning: this film is not for the faint of heart. What surprised me is that the scene where Aron 'releases' himself is visually very graphic. I won't go into detail, but you really shouldn't watch this if you don't have the stomach.There were only a few minor things which bothered me during this film. It has a few moments which, inevitably are a bit boring. But then again, even that seems to fit into the story, so perhaps it makes sense. And I personally think the music wasn't always very well chosen, some of it didn't really fit somehow. But none of this is really any bother.127 Hours may not be as profound as Into the Wild, but it's certainly a very well-crafted film which deserves respect on its own merits. Also, the photography of the film is really beautiful and some of the scenery of the canyons is truly breathtaking. I would recommend it for the pretty pictures alone. Anyhow, if you're interested in a really good episode of ""I shouldn't be alive"", this is the film for you.

Aron left without even telling anyone where he was going, so it could be weeks before anyone notices that he is even missing. Alone with no help around for miles, Aron had to ration his food and water carefully before doing what he had to do to survive...I was highly anticipating this film when I first seen the trailers and read all about it. It only served to raise my hopes more when I saw that Danny Boyle was at the helm, the brilliant director of ""Trainspotting"" and ""28 Days Later"" (However, he disappointed me with the terrible ""Sunshine"" in 2007). The main problem with ""127 Hours"" is that it's extremely boring. Well, what do I expect? You'll probably ask. It is after all essentially just about a man stuck under a rock for the entire length of the film, but that isn't the problem. I watched ""Buried"" awhile ago, about a man stuck in a coffin for the whole film, and I thought that was excellent. But ""127 Hours"" is extremely boring and the non-existent script only serves to make you wonder how much effort was really put into it. Boyle does an awful job with this film, and his MTV style directing for the hallucinations/flashbacks was just a necessary distraction to get us away from the excruciating scenes before us with James Franco debating whether or not he should cut his arm off. (A scene which is done rather well later on, it has to be said.) People will flock to this movie inevitably because it's based on a true story, which is understandable. Ralston himself has credited the film as being accurate, and he himself is still climbing today despite his disability which is great to hear. Overall I found this to be a terrible film and a complete waste of time. Excruciatingly boring.

Aron Ralston sets out for a weekend trip to a slot canyon in the Canyonlands National Park in Utah, gets pinned by a boulder, and after five days frees himself and makes it out alive. The movie succeeded in dramatizing the event in a manner that kept my attention. The introduction that has Ralston bicycling in some twenty miles to the entry of the canyon was the highlight of the film for me. It captured the thrill of being alone in a spectacularly magical and beautiful landscape and feeling truly alive. This part of the movie makes a great advertisement for Utah. A Canyonlands travelogue on Blu-ray would make for great entertainment.It was dumb for Ralston not to have told anyone where he was going, which he admits, but I am willing to give him a pass on this, at least from what we see of him in the movie. He was in his 20s, in the peak of health, and an experienced outdoors-man--I could see how he might feel invincible and make the mistake he did.Whereas this movie personalizes the experience, I found the NBC Dateline documentary ""Desperate Days in Blue John Canyon"" to have a greater emotional impact. In that film Tom Brokaw accompanies Ralston on a repeat of his fateful journey. This was only six months after the original event and it astonished me that Ralston had the courage to do it. Fitted with a prosthesis he made the whole trip without aid, from lowering himself into the canyon to the repel out. Seeing some of Ralston's actual video as well as hearing the audio of other parts had a much greater impact on me that seeing Franco duplicate it, even as good as Franco is in the role. And we are spared seeing the graphic details of the main event--hearing Ralston describe it is quite enough. This documentary is available on YouTube.It's easy to be convinced of the fragility of life, but the value of this movie is to see the other end of that spectrum, what a body can withstand at the outer limits of endurance.

There are large chunks of the movie that have no dialog, but unless you realize there is no talking you don't really notice it. Franco does a great job with this part and is very enjoyable to watch.

I was really excited, because I'm a big fan of survival stories and I already knew this one because Bear Grylls mentioned it on ""Man Vs. Wild"", which is a show I watch a lot. Unfourtunetely, this movie's premiere here in Portugal was last week, that's about two months after the American premiere. That meant I would have to wait a long time to see this movie. I could have downloaded it, but I wanted to see this movie with good quality and subtitles so I waited. It was hard but, oh boy, it was all worth it!!!I loved how the movie started, it started quickly, with great music and editing. I couldn't ask for more!I just think the part when Aron falls into the crevasse should have more emphasis. It was because of that fall that the movie was made and that Aron did what he did.. I think they should have added some slow-motion. :)The scenes from the crevasse have a different meaning with James Franco. He is perfect for the role and he can make us live Aron's drama is such way that sometimes it looks we are also there. Brilliant! Anguish, sadness, happiness, joy... ""127 Hours"" and James Franco can make us laugh and cry and the same time; it's such a great movie!The infamous amputation scene was not painful to watch. I don't like horror movies, because all of the gory and bloody scenes, so I was a bit afraid of this scene. But I could watch the scene without closing my eyes or even covering or turning my face away. It's really no big deal, but fortunately for me, a girl got out of the cinema after that scene and that made me win a bet with my friends! :PI've already watched ""The King's Speech"", so I know what Colin Firth did in that movie. He was amazing and deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor, but if it wasn't for him, I think Franco should have won it. He's great.Overall, it was an amazing movie, although it was too short, but I guess that most people don't want to see a guy talking alone in a crevasse for 2 hours. I wouldn't mind! I was not hoping such a quiet movie, but I loved it. When it finished, I wanted to see it again and I probably will see it again next week with more friends.I really think everybody should see this movie. Don't avoid it, just because of the amputation scene. If you are fragile, close your eyes, you will know when it's over because of the music (by the way, the music from that scene is great).Probably my favorite movie.

At first I had my doubts about whether this film would be worth the hype and after reading the reviews I was intrigued about how it would actually work. These doubts however, were completely shrugged off after a gripping and entertaining watch of a film I can only describe as an emotional roller-coaster. I got so involved with this film. Boyle really does have a nack of moving his audience to connecting with characters and through out this film he does just that. Although James Franco's character appears to be a tough and edgey character, you begin to really feel for him and almost emphasise the pain he is going through. So when the sh** hits the fan and he is led no other option but to take his own arm, you understand his logic of survival and courage which distracts you from the utter gore of such an horrific scene.

And once the movie started, it was a bit weird for me (people going up escalator's , etc....), but then i started noticing the editing. I said to myself: ""Wow... This is mazing!"" The editing in this film was truly amazing. After Aaron runs into the 2 girls, it really shows you that he had a nice spirit and was very adventurous. After getting stuck between the rock, he starts to remember the past in his life.i thought that that was a nice way, in fact a really nice way to make the movie good. I thought, before walking into the theater: ""How will Danny Boyle make you entertained when its just that man stuck between a rock?"" Now Danny Boyle really finds a way in this film to make it to make it entertaining and not boring and and make the film stand out to be not just the guy cutting his arm off but, but finding ways to save himself, remembering he times when he was young and making sure that if he makes it out alive, that he always answers his parents' calls.This films is for me by far the best of the year and i think that it should win best picture ( even though i think that the king's speech or black swan will win) of the year and makes me think of James Franko as a much better actor and Danny Boyle a much better director.

All of Danny Boyle's films (especially this one) have a creative artistic flare which drives them forward and captures the audience throughout. I researched into the main events of the true story of Aron Ralston a while ago during its release in the US, so I already knew what was coming in terms of plot.(Those who don't know prior to watching the film are in for quite an experience.) I thought that knowing what was going to happen would damper the initial viewing for me but this was not the case in any circumstance. They're so many aspects of this film that keep you intertwined during the 94 minutes but most of the praise for this would have to go to James Franco. Franco's performance is outstanding and this has to be one of his best performances i have seen from him. He appears in pretty much every scene and his adaptation of Aron Ralston clearly shows that he has put in the effort needed for this title role. Another thing worth mentioning is the soundtrack that includes original pieces by A. R. Rahman. The music fits the film near perfect throughout and it wouldn't surprise if a few nominations or awards will pop out during the events of 2011.This film may not be for the faint hearted during some scenes and not for those who dislike previous Danny Boyle films that have a unique artistic flare but for everyone else - This is a must see movie. The film has been made very well - the layout, camera sequences, sound editing and the terrific performance by James Franco has put this film in the front row for one of the best films of 2011 (UK).

Frankly 127 Hours deserves a handful of these. This movie grabbed my attention straight away, from the first shot. Throughout we see the camera split in two screens, hand-held, documentary style like camera and conventional shooting. The first minute shows a marvellous split screen montage, which is then split into three as we are introduced to James Franco's character based on a true story Aron Ralston who whilst hiking and climbing in the canyons of Utah comes across two pretty female hikers Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn) who are lost, he helps them find their way and they find out is a cocky, daredevil free type guy who likes to have fun when they jump into a large pool from climbing in between two walls that opens into a large cave face. I felt the rush and adrenaline as he and the girls jumped into the pool as though I was actually there and that's what makes this thing even more authentic with the way it was shot and the fact it is based on a true story.Eventually though he leaves them to do his own thing but falls down a small canyon and gets his right arm stuck between the wall and large rock. This happens about twenty minutes in and from the look in Aron's eyes it's clear he never faced this sort of helplessness before. From here we really get inside the character's head as he tries desperately to escape trying several methods, whilst at the same time trying to survive on little food and water as he talks into his video-camera about how he feels as he begins to hallucinate as his situation deteriorates rapidly over the five days he is stuck there. From being trapped Aron starts to realise his selfishness at how he has lived his life and treated other people like not keeping in contact with his parents, by taking them for granted and his unwillingness to commit. All these are told in flashbacks. Also wisely throughout Aron's ordeal Boyle has added a few moments of bleak humour that lightens the mood slightly and gives the film a better balance.127 Hours is truly a film that perfectly captures the human spirit and will to survive as we see Aron desperately trying to escape his predicament. We the audience are fully versed to Aron's fear and regrets, as I felt whilst watching it, the fact I sometimes take my family for granted and for a movie to do that, make the viewer pause and reflect on themselves is not something that is easily done, which makes the film all the more clever for it. Not only that you are tuned to the notion of coming to care about him and want him to get out as I related to him, you can place yourself in his shoes imagining yourself in a similar situation. The stylish camera-work helps reinforce that but so does James Franco's performance, I quite like him in the Spiderman films, but this was more real-life, serious drama and a role that challengingly flexed him and he worked up to it, with a performance of his life. It was tremendous and he has already been nominated for an award, which is richly deserved. As to far as the amputation scene, it is very brutal, yes and if you are squeamish of blood I wouldn't recommend it but the full impact is shortened in the film so it isn't as shocking as it seems and I have seen worse. 127 Hours though I can recommend fully for those who want to find a simple but incredibly fascinating true story of character. I saw my first film of the year last week, which was The Next Three Days with Russell Crowe, which was excellent, but this was even better. This film is serious contender for best film of 2011 so far, but there are still eleven months to go so we'll see. Let's hope 2011 for terrific films continues. 127 Hours truly is one of the most memorable films I have ever seen and I can't give it higher praise than that.

There he gets into an accident that leaves his arm stuck by a rock. With little water and food Aron is trapped for five days, time while he reflects back to his life, friends, family and battles brutal inhumane will, courage and strength to free himself and be saved. As the trailer says--- ""There is no force on Earth more powerful than the will to live"".James Franco portrays Aron Ralston, and lets be honest, he does that remarkably well. It is just such a powerful performance helped by superb camera-work and visuals. I haven't been this impressed for a long long time. The cinematography is really strong and the film itself is brilliantly edited. 127 Hours has just such a fantastic style. Weather its Aron cycling in the desert, stunning long shots of the nature or simple highway lights at nights town, Boyle captures it all splendidly.

More often than not, it leads to me drawling a far too subjective conclusion on something too fresh to have fully settled in. With 127 Hours, I have decided to make an exception because I think the way I feel about the film immediately after viewing it adds an element to the review that can't be conveyed in words. What's the element- complete and utter exhilaration and total mental exhaustion.I've been involved in two big accidents since the day I started driving. Both resulted in two totaled cars (mine and the others), a serious hike in insurance, and a healthy reminder to continually wear a seat belt no matter how far I'm going. I remember vividly the moment directly after each accident. I gathered myself, looked around, felt my legs to make sure they were working, and then said to myself, ""there's no way that just happened."" In 127 Hours, Aron Ralston is put in a similar situation, except instead of getting in an accident, he falls down a cliff and instead of feeling around and realizing his legs are still working, he looks down to see his arm smashed and pinned directly under a huge rock. Regardless of the change in scenarios, both stories end with the same quote, ""there's no way that just happened.""127 Hours is based on the true story of Aron Ralston, a rebel, a rock climber, and a fully independent adult ready to take on the cliffs in Moab, Utah for a routine weekend excursion. He packs his things, hits the trails, and embarks on a beautiful journey by bike, but he makes one serious mistake- he tells no one where he's going before he leaves. Much of this is indicative of Aron's lifestyle which could be considered fly solo and by the seat of your pants. In his defense however, the story that's about to unfold is one of almost impossible calculations. He couldn't have seen it coming, but maybe it was just written in the stars.90% of the film takes place one on one with Aron, played by James Franco, as he's trapped inside the canyon walls. There's no special effects or camera trickery, just Franco, a camera, a slew of supplies which he happened to have on him during the accident, and of course us, the audience, watching every move the actor makes on screen. For Franco, this is an extremely personal film. We're on him for an hour and a half, close ups of his face, his eyes, his arm, his body, watching and writhing as he tries everything he can to survive. He plays the part extremely well, with every emotion striking through the rocks like a sharp nail. There's no way he will be denied a nomination for this performance at this year's Academy Awards.When I started reviewing this film, I wanted to open with the line, ""There's only one way to describe 127 Hours, and that word is awesome."" Then I got to thinking. There isn't just one way to describe this film, there's tons, and trust me, every way you turn it, the outcome is positive. This film is awesome, exhilarating, breathtaking, brutal, exhausting, and at times, almost impossible to watch. There's literally no way not to respond to this film, as there is no one in this world who could not sympathize for someone literally stuck under a rock, fully aware of their untimely predicament and the fact that they literally have no chance of getting saved or better yet, unstuck. It's like being fully aware in a vegetative state, but worse, because you can actually move, you're in 44 degree weather, and you're drinking your own urine to survive. It makes my stomach cringe just thinking about it.As other critics have already eluded to and anyone at least somewhat familiar with the film's story line already knows about, the final scenes in the film are almost impossible to watch without either A. fainting, B. leaving the theater, or C. having to turn your head. My father and I both opted for the turn of the head, but I saw multiple individuals (specifically females) who had to opt for option B for the lengthy 6 minute scene. It's shown in brutal detail, leaving nothing to the imagination, which in my opinion, wasn't totally necessary, but does add a sense of authenticity and accomplishment when it comes to what Aron has to do to get free.127 Hours is an amazing film. I've never felt so exhausted after leaving a theater. The very final moments of the film felt better than any film I've seen recently. I look up to Aron, not for being some sort of hero or even for being a genuinely good person, but for the fact that he went through the worst 5 days I could ever imagine, and survived.. It's one of the most amazing achievements I've ever heard a human make, and the way it was captured and brought to the screen can't receive any higher praise from me.127 Hours is a tough film to watch, but one that shouldn't be missed. It will be on my top 10 of the year, it's just a matter of what number.Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com "," Rarely   compelled  review  movie immediately  seeing   film.  often  not,  leads   drawling  far  subjective conclusion  something  fresh   fully settled .  127 Hours,   decided  make  exception   think  way  feel   film immediately  viewing  adds  element   review  can't  conveyed  words.   element- complete  utter exhilaration  total mental exhaustion.I've  involved  two big accidents   day  started driving.  resulted  two totaled cars (mine   others),  serious hike  insurance,   healthy reminder  continually wear  seat belt no matter  far  going.  remember vividly  moment directly   accident.  gathered , looked , felt  legs  make sure   working,   said  , "" no way  just happened.""  127 Hours, Aron Ralston  put   similar situation,  instead  getting   accident,  falls down  cliff  instead  feeling   realizing  legs  still working,  looks down  see  arm smashed  pinned directly under  huge rock.

Here is where he has his big oops moment, because you see, Aron never told anyone where he was going and for how long. On top of that he forgot his one essential tool, the ''Swiss army knife"". Which later would have come in great use when he cuts his own arm off. Oh yes, he does and its gruesome. (but not to the point where anyone would faint. I've heard the stories and I don't get it, its not that bad.) It is here where his journey of survival begins. As he hallucinates and ponders on all the things that he done in his life, the girl he loved, and the family he'll miss. We the audience can't help but question ourselves, what would we do? Based on the unbelievable true story of Aron Ralston, ""127 hours"" is a rousing achievement in film making. Its a gorgeous looking film yet under the direction of Danny Boyle it definitely has an Indie touch. You know you're going to see something different. Much of the time is spent with James Franco's character and for this reason he has to be completely present and captivating. Franco's knocks it out of the park, he is fantastic in this role and does an amazing job taking us on his character's emotional roller coaster ride. A.R. Rahman joins Boyle for the second time and nails the music. It has a wonderful soundtrack.

127 Hours,684,moviemanMA,19/Nov/10,9,5.16479033766105e-07,film one not good will even time best can way life characters much make only see performance though people many something sense character feel man audience,0.333333333,6.0,inf,inf,inf," In 127 Hours, we follow Ralston, played by James Franco, a person who lives life to the fullest and on his terms. His lifestyle pushes others away, but for him that's okay, a choice that will haunt him. While taking a weekend trip to Blue John Canyon, Ralston finds himself in the precarious situation of having his arm wedged under a boulder. With limited supplies, Ralston must find the best way out of this mess, all the while ensuring his survival. With some rope, tethers, a cheap multi-tool, and headlamp, he goes through trial after trial of attempting to free his arm.Entering the film, I was curious as to the techniques Boyle would employ to keep us invested. After all, watching a guy under a rock for five days sounds like an Andy Warhol film. I was expecting to see cutaways to people who would be looking for him. We soon find out that no one knows he is there. Then I realized that Boyle's angle is to put us in that canyon trapped under the very same boulder. Our only advantage over Ralston is that we can move freely in our seats pain free, though we go through each event be it drinking water, urinating, stretching for sunlight, or doing the unthinkable of removing one's limb.By putting us in the canyon, our minds start to race, much like Ralston. His only escape is through his camcorder with which he documents his time, and with his endless parade of thoughts and memories, both good and bad. Imagine having that much time by yourself and the flood of memories and emotions that would creep into your head. It's mind boggling and borderline disorienting to think about. Through Franco's performance we see how this forced isolation influences ones thoughts so much.Franco, much like the boulder on top of his arm, is rock solid throughout the film. The opening sequences show his free spirited nature and inability to stay on the ground let alone in one place. He whizzes around the canyon, confident with every step and every peddle of his bicycle. Once trapped in the canyon, he is confined to staying put, something his character is not used to. Franco was so convincing that I forgot about the character and focused on my own emotions. He did many of the things I saw myself doing with the same expressions. As the film progresses we feel every emotion and sense every sensation.To help with this process, Boyle employs creative camera shots, sound effects, and editing techniques. Due to the cramped space, Boyle puts the camera in virtually every crevice and height imaginable, including shots from inside his water bottle and even one inside his arm. Each movement is accompanied by a slew of sounds that intensify and bombard our senses. One in particular utilizes an electric guitar buzz when Ralston attempts at severing a nerve. Cut all of this with editing straight from a Jason Bourne film and you have an intense, dramatic sequence of events that keeps the audience engaged.On an estimated budget of around 18 million dollars, Boyle utilizes his leading actor, Franco, his beautiful locations in Utah, and an incredible arsenal of editing points, coverage shots, and foley artistry to create a portrait of a lone man pushed to the edge. Like so many of Boyle's characters, they are presented with an obstacle, be it a zombie onslaught or a game show, and we are able to see how the choices they make both in the present situation and in their prior experiences influence and determine their ultimate outcome.Ralston is confronted with the idea of his entire life's journey has led him to this rock at this time and in this place, leading to the conclusion that everything happens for a reason. As for Boyle, we're all thankful for the path he has chosen.

Danny Boyle certainly used his Oscar winning status to its full advantage and made sure a project he wanted to make for a while was commissioned.127 Hours is the true story about Aron Ralston (James Franco), a 27-year-old climber and adventurer. In 2003 Aron goes off to Blue John Canyon to explore and have fun, meeting two young ladies on the way, Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn). After they leave Aron ends up getting his arm trapped in a crack in the Earth and for the next 127 hours he has do everything he can to survive and tries to free his arm. As he does this he think about his love ones, his mum (Kate Burton), Dad (Treat Williams), sister and ex-girlfriend Rana (Clemence Posey) as he thinks about how selfish he has been and how no one will find him.Danny Boyle is a great director having made Trainspotting, 28 Days Later and Slumdog Millionaire. He has such a great visual style and he brings it to a film which most directors would struggle to make visual. Boyle uses some really great tricks, from the zooming in and out of canyons into underground pools or show the crack in the world. To expand the setting Boyle and the screenwriter Simon Beaufoy showed flashbacks and memories to make 127 Hours more then just a man talking to a camera and trying to get his arm free. We get to see Aron grow, being regretful and remorseful and that he is a resourceful but reckless man. James Franco does offer an excellent performance and we possibility get a Oscar nod.Boyle did give the film an almost documentary style because he uses places the camera in one position as people talk, keeps editing down to a minimum and uses hand held cameras that follow people and a small camcorder for when Aron leaves messages. But there is no rubbish shaky cam or zooming like there was with Paul Greengrass' Green Zone which looked like an amateur film. The cinematography by Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle of the Utah was wonderful and shows a very strange and unique landscape. A.R. Rahman gives a great score and soundtrack to 127 Hours and Boyle uses the music to add to the build up in the film, like the bit of music that sounds like a heartbeat.Everyone who went to see the film knows that Aron Ralston had to amputate his own arm and Boyle was aware of what the audience do know. He plays on this, using the music and the playing and examining of the knife in anticipation of the coming event. This is a spoiler but I have to say it, the amputation scene was strong, brutal and powerful. Aron had to hack away with a small knife and you really felt the pain when he had to cut through a nerve ending. But I personally whined more when I saw Aron take out a contact lens (but that's because I have a slight phobia of eyeballs).Whilst 127 Hours was a good film, it was not great like some critics made out. I was a little under whelmed and for me the film felt a little hollow. Boyle still made a good film, but its not his best (that right goes to Trainspotting). I expect it will be nominated for some Oscars but it does not deserves to win Best Picture or Best Director (sorry Mr. Boyle).7.5 out of 10.

Danny Boy has done it again in the gripping ""127 Hours"", the movie based on the true story of mountain climber Aaron Ralston. While canyoneering in Utah 2003, Ralston had a boulder crash on his arm; trapping him in an isolated canyon for (yea, you guessed it) 127 hours! Ralston's remarkable survival story is what entraps viewers in ""127 Hours"". Boyle is definitely not a lazy director, and his energy and workmanship is shown around the clock in ""127 Hours""; from Aaron's survival skills, to the expeditious visuals of Aaron's adventuristic persona, to Aaron's desperate motives of detachment; I hope I did not have to arm wrestle with your brain in figuring that last one out. Speaking of detachment, the ""arm self-amputation"" scene of the movie is the one that is stirring a buzz in movie world. It's the authenticity of the scene and not so much its graphic nature that makes it work. And of course, the bold Boyle is responsible for its excellence. ""127 Hours"" screenplay was mediocre at best; probably due to the nature of the movie, so I am not trying to take anything away from the film's screenwriters Simon Beaufoy and Boyle himself. Nature and its catastrophic capabilities play an integral role in the film highlighted by the superb technical work of: Cinematographers Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle, Art Director Christopher DeMuri, and Production Designer Suttirat Anne Larlarb. They all deserve Oscar nominations! Jon Harris' master cutting in editing the movie, and A.R. Rahman's master tuning in scoring the movie are also climbing the Oscar mountain of nominations for those applicable categories. But to be ""Franco"" with you, the peak of ""127 Hours"" has to be James Franco's mesmerizing performance as Aaron Ralston. I will give my right arm (I know, wrong choice of words; Sorry Aaron!) to have James Franco be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Wait a minute! I don't think I would have to give my right arm since he is already a favorite for a Best Actor Oscar nomination! Sorry, I guess I was arm & hammered when I wrote that last statement. Anyways, Franco's emotional, rawpower thespian work will definitely make the cut as one of the most talked about acting performance of the year. There is not much of a supporting acting ensemble to ""127 Hours"" since it was Franco's showcase. But we did get a treat in seeing veteran actor Treat Williams appear as Aaron's dad; and there were a couple of sharp performances from Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn as mountain climbers that Aaron meets before his downfall. I will not proclaim ""127 Hours"" as the best movie of the year; it still has a few mountains to climb before it reaches that apex. But nevertheless, Franco and Boyle definitely make it worth your while to spend 93 minutes with ""127 Hours"".

I think Boyle wanted to make this more of a bold adventure film rather than a soulful drama, so there were moments with quick, flashy editing and pumping music, and occasions for drug-like hallucinations.

He didn't notify anyone that he was going hiking alone one time in 2003, where he accidentally had his arm pinned by a boulder in a canyon for five days, and ended up amputating the arm to escape. This is indeed what Danny Boyle's remarkable ""127 Hours"" is about. It's one of the very best films I've seen so far this year.It begins with Aron, played excellently by James Franco, in his home getting ready for that unbeknownst life changing experience. We see split screens, people running a marathon in fast motion, and other fast motion cinematography that resembles the documentary ""Koyaanisqatsi"". There's even similar rock art briefly shown. (Could it be the same?) I don't know if there's a purpose for this surreal style Boyle has chosen to open the film with, which is occasionally used for the rest of it, but maybe it's to make your viewing experience and Aron's experience to sometimes feel like a dream. In other words, what's happening to Aron shouldn't be happening, but it is, of course. In any case, I loved the style and the cinematography in general is stunning, but particularly of the canyon and desert. Say, those are more ""Koyaanisqatsi"" resemblances.As Aron travels through the desert and canyon, he meets two young women who are lost. He guides them and soon departs. This is the last time he comes in contact with anyone before and during the period of being trapped. A boulder crushes his arm in between canyon walls and he has to survive with the few supplies he has, like a bottle of water and some food. He's saddened, dehydrated, hungry, remorseful, bored, you get the idea. The film turns not much happening into cinematic genius. We feel empathetic for him, engage in what he does and thinks about, like his past, and we imagine that we'd never ever want to be in his position. The film has a neat bag of tricks to show. There are fantasy sequences, like Aron escaping to his ex-girlfriend. He creates a talk show with himself since he brought a video camera, complete with audience responses. I guess it was made for black humour, but I hardly felt like laughing. Of course, he occasionally tries to escape. He uses pocket pliers with a dull knife to chip away at the boulder, but doesn't make progress. In the end, he has no choice but to amputate his arm. It's a particularly powerful and somewhat squeamish scene. I've read that audience members have fainted and have even required medical assistance. I was OK with the scene since I'm used to gory things in horror films and nobody in the theatre I was in fainted. As he's being rescued, I almost felt like crying. The glorious music is partly why. Aron has made it.I honestly cannot think of any flaws with this film. Aron is portrayed as a likable guy who obviously made a very bad mistake. The reason isn't explained, but maybe it's because he's just a little arrogant. Nothing about the film is pretentious, though. It reminds me of ""Into the Wild"" and Gus Van Sant's ""Gerry"", which I both love, although ""Gerry"" is an acquired taste, for lack of a better term. I swear there's a resemblance in ""127 Hours"" with a flashback of Aron's friend on a different boulder that he mysteriously climbed up. Actually, I think he has the proper equipment, unlike Casey Affleck's character in ""Gerry"", but it's still interesting to note.""127 Hours"" is Oscar worthy, particularly for Best Picture. The film is another high point in Danny Boyle's career, along with ""Trainspotting"" and ""Slumdog Millionaire"". (He likes making different films, doesn't he?) I've decided ""127 Hours"" is also one of my favourite films. I admit I know little about the real Aron Ralston, but he's shown not as a hero, but a survivor.

127 Hours,689,alerter,13/Nov/10,10,2.5448088157022042e-14,film one not story will well even films time can life much make makes work still drama fun never see heart made also performance without documentary people many ever something real years human sense american feel get better full really far long right moments might,0.375,8.0,inf,inf,inf," It took four years for Danny Boyle to be able to make a non-documentary film based on the real life ordeal of American mountaineer and adventurer Aron Ralston.The early obstacle was Ralston, who originally insisted that his memoir, Between_a_Rock_and_a_Hard_Place, had to be filmed as a straight documentary. What eventually changed Ralston's mind was Boyle's phenomenal Slumdog Millionaire. Boyle also had to call in every industry marker owed to him, over the financial success of Slumdog, in order to finally get 127 Hours made. The end result is another work of genius from Boyle and co-writer Simon Beaufoy and a tour de force performance by James Franco portraying Ralston.127 Hours winds up being truer to the momentous essence of Ralston's story than straight documentary could have managed.We get to see and enjoy some of the upsides of Ralston's pre-ordeal ""hard hero"" lifestyle. It's fun and exhilarating for also being reckless and extremely fortunate, right up to the point when the luck runs out.A failure to prepare (beyond sheer physical ability) compounds the direness of a seemingly single misstep that turns out to be one in a long line of lucky mistakes. When every ounce matters, better gear was packed for entertainment (CD player, camera, video recorder, spare AA batteries) than for survival (dynamic rope, harness webbing, 'biners, headlamp, belay device and a poorly maintained, no-name multi-tool with blades as dull as a butter knife). Not a single rock tool among them. (What blade sharpens itself, except in TV commercials?) None of that's about hindsight being 20-20; it's about training and preparedness. Ralston full well knew better.As sensational as Ralston's true story is, Boyle makes a shrewd choice to underplay the pivotal act that Ralston is forced to commit, in order to save his own life, so that viewers never lose sight of the larger context of the story (insouciant selfishness) and are permitted to get inside of Ralston's expanding frame of mind. We see what we have to see and nothing more. (Some of what Ralston really did to his necrotic right hand is never depicted in the film, because it would have thrown the film far off into Saw territory.) This is very important, because frank self-criticism is an essential and transformative element of Ralston's experience. This is more profound than regret or even the will to live. This allows the many messages embedded within the story to have an impact on us, without over doing it.Life threatening shock, elemental exposure, exhaustion, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and likely early onset blood poisoning can individually, let alone in combination, produce moments of vivid hallucination and even supposed lucid premonition, in real life -- and to the film's story telling advantage. Some license is taken with these episodes, but mostly on the margins, with dazzling camera work. Much of what we see is what Ralston says he experienced and I have no doubts about the latter. What's even more amazing is how fully Franco immerses himself in episodes of grim determination and then delirium.I was an avid non-professional climber back in the 1970s-80s, but not one of the gonzo-types with something to prove. I always knew that no matter what any human being brings to bear out in the elements, Mother Nature's got plenty of surprises that can overwhelm anyone and everyone. I climbed with a self-selected group who trained together and shared a life-and-death view that each of us goes in, and comes back, with ten fingers and ten toes. Every time. We began and ended with dotted I-s and crossed T-s of outdoorsmanship. We maintained our equipment because safety depended on it. We studied mountaineering medicine and wilderness survival, because we knew we'd have to rely on ourselves, not on radios or cel phones, in a jam. We practiced tying proper knots with one hand, because you can never know when you might have to. Every climb was technical, yet even with proper equipment in correct use, when things went wrong, it could happen faster than you could snap your fingers. Randomness (luck) always remains a factor; but luck tends to punish the prepared less.I've fallen on belay, with the sickening experience of carabiners popping out, one after another. Ideally, they're not supposed to do that, but, at the same time, they're still helping to slow my fall, while I hope that one will finally hold, before I crash to a dead stop on top of some hard, unyielding thing. It's an icy feeling. It happens fast. You, and your fast belayer, think those thoughts.Franco's sudden fall from the chockstone struck me as being very realistic, but that didn't hit me viscerally. The moment when Franco *chose* to break his radius and then his ulna, that's when I felt my blood leaving my hands and feet, in involuntary sympathetic shock, resurrecting a body memory of my own mishaps on climbs.While self-rescue was a huge part of this story, Ralston would still have perished if he had not come upon the three vacationing hikers from the Netherlands, who provided him with water and food and then summoned a rescue helicopter.Ralston extricated himself, but he likely still would not have survived all by himself.While I'm not sure if Ralston has ever said it in exactly the words used in my title, the profoundly correct grasp of karma, as spoken by Franco at one point in the film, must be at the heart of why Ralston has said that he did not lose his hand, rather, he gained back his life, in the sense of his conscious connectedness to all of the people who are in it.127 Hours has a grippingly authentic general feel that perfectly compliments the specific drama. It's artistry is everywhere, in the script, the cinematography, the score, set design, editing, direction and acting.Absolutely Oscar worthy, on multiple counts.

It just puts you right into a harrowing situation and never lets you go until the end, but you'll be glad you stayed through. As much as it is a hard film to sit through, the film is mainly about hope and the will to survive, which I like because I'm not a pessimistic person.James Franco gives the performance of his career and carries the film really well on his shoulders, which is a good thing considering we're with him for the rest of the film. Although Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn, two lovely actresses, have short roles in the film, it's always nice to see them. The editing plays a huge role in the film as well.

This film marked my first film festival experience, and-- due to its great impact-- it will be impossible to forget. It's definitely one of the most intense films I have ever seen. But on top of being a real nail-biter, it's also very emotional and deeply humane. What follows will be my in-depth thoughts on Danny Boyle's ""127 Hours""... In all honesty, I wasn't expecting much from this film. I only purchased tickets for its screening because it was one of the few ""premium screenings"" that wasn't sold out (I was originally excited for Black Swan and Hereafter, both of which were sold out after the first day of ticket sales). I was only looking forward to the festival experience. I had already heard about the heroic story of Aron Ralston-- the true life-or-death experience that the film was based on-- and after hearing about the upcoming film, I must admit that I laughed quite a bit. I thought it would be a pathetic plot for a film, and that it would get nowhere at all. Was I ever wrong with my predictions! While viewing ""127 Hours"", my low expectations were gradually surpassed. My final thoughts on the film soared way above my original ones. I've never been so surprised in my life. For those of you who are oblivious, ""127 Hours"" is about the true story of a mountain climber named Aron Ralston, whose arm was trapped under a boulder during a solitary canyon expedition in Utah. Although some people may consider this a SPOILER, I must tell you that the film focuses on his deepest thoughts, leading up to the moment where he resorts to severing his own arm in order to survive. Nevertheless, the whole audience was thrilled by this film, even though everyone was aware of the man's fate beforehand (Aron Ralston was presented on stage before the film was shown). Right from the start, I was captivated and intrigued. And I wasn't alone; the entire audience was as immersed as I was. Every so often, the film would have the whole audience gasping, cringing, or laughing-- all in unison. And then there was the moment where James Franco's character finally cut off his entire arm. The whole audience clapped, instantly. Everyone was blown away, mesmerized. Danny Boyle excels in directing, as usual. I loved ""Slumdog Millionaire"", so it was nice to see that he teamed up with the same screenwriter, Simon Beaufoy, on this project. I was particularly blown away by their ability to craft a film (""127 Hours"") that stars one man (James Franco) and that is mainly shot in one restrained location (a gap in the canyon), while managing to captivate the audience. Wow. This marks a ground-breaking achievement in filmmaking. The viewer's interest is maintained throughout the whole film, thanks to the emotional glimpses of his deepest thoughts during all the suspense over his survival. It manages to be one of the most poignant, heartfelt stories of this year's cinema, while also being one of most thrilling and intense. It really puts you on the edge of your seat! James Franco delivers an OUTSTANDING performance as Aron Ralston. He is so convincing that you can't help but slip into his shoes and feel the pain and suffering he is experiencing. He also manages to get numerous laughs out of the audience with little bits of humour here and there. I wouldn't be surprised if he snags an acting nomination at next year's Academy Awards, among all the other categories that this film is likely to contend in. In the theatre, as the credits began to roll, the whole audience participated in a standing ovation that was sustained for five minutes. It was the greatest film reaction I have ever witnessed. Danny Boyle, Simon Beaufoy, James Franco, Aron Ralston, and a few others took the stage afterwards to answer questions from the audience. They were very grateful of the wonderful reception this film got that night. Leaving the theatre, I had the opportunity to share my thoughts on the movie with the distributor, Fox Searchlight. They recorded my friend Shakyl-- also a cinephile-- and I, and asked us some questions on the movie. The footage will possibly be used in a promotional commercial! We'll have to see! Overall, Danny Boyle's ""127 Hours"" is a masterful film that will blow away all audiences when it will be released in November. You really can't afford to miss this deep, intense, powerful, and emotional piece of cinema! It will always remain vividly in my mind as one of the most memorable theatre experiences of my lifetime.

He didn't buddy up with someone, he didn't properly pack and most importantly he didn't tell anyone where he went. Call that irresponsible or call that the life of a risk taker and a gambler at heart. Right out of the gate, Aron shortly acts as a tour guide to two newly met girls, Kristi and Megan, who he treats with a little bit of unsure mysteriousness but know-how for adventure before going off on his own. While climbing down a cavern wall, a medium-sized rock comes loose and Aron falls down with it and gets his hand dislodged against an enclosed wall space, thus starting ""127 hours"" of his struggle.Instead of just doing a quiet, emotion-on-the-face type movie, this switches between and interacts through a portable video camera that Aron talks into towards an imaginary audience similar to ""Grizzly Man."" This mode of interaction transforms the viewer to live and breath the moment-by-moment with the character as opposed to a piece that would look back with a dry and comfortable voice over top. Like the ball with a face in ""Cast Away,"" Aron's camera becomes his friend to converse and reminisce with to bide his time. He's a guy who is used to falling down but always getting right back up again with a few scrapes to talk later about. He has a sense of cheer and humor despite the grim circumstances and won't let negativity get the best of him. He plans, he thinks and he ultimately becomes the situation and makes it routine through his wrist watch keeping time to the various items he brought in his pack to help him survive the best way he can.There's going to be stylish film mechanics to keep things moving, such as frequent camera angles and interspersed music to lend feeling. There's a consistent pacing with ""127 Hours"" that's capable of showing what he went through without making it tedious or over-dramatizing; sometimes even upbeat and at one point philosophical. This can also be candid and straightforward, as well dreamy and sentimental. James Franco transforms this real life person into a likable guy who seems like he is always searching for something and on the move, that is until he got stuck in a predicament of predicaments which brought out every ounce of what perseverance, knowledge and endurance he has in him to either wait and get rescued, beat his body's clock or make a sacrifice.

For it, he assembled a crew that included ""Slumdog"" Oscar winners Simon Beaufoy (screenwriter) and A.R. Rahman (composer). The film garnered six richly deserved Oscar nominations but unfortunately failed to win any.The true story concerns mountain climber Aron Ralston who becomes trapped in an isolated canyon in Utah. With his arm pinned under a heavy boulder his outlook is bleak but he courageously refuses to give up. About three quarters of the film takes place stuck in one spot but Boyle & Beaufoy keep the action interesting by incorporating flashback and dream sequences.The film is practically a one man show with James Franco tackling the Ralston role. It's a demanding role and one that sees Franco deliver on the promise that he showed years ago. He would have been a deserving Oscar winner but faced tough competition from Colin Firth. Besides Franco there are a handful of other notables in small roles, all of whom contribute solid performances.Boyle's direction is superb and nothing if not Oscar worthy. Like Franco, Boyle was presented with a tough task and rose to the challenge. Credit should also be given to co-screenwriter Simon Beaufoy and editor Jon Harris for keeping the narrative flowing. Then there's the stellar music by A.R. Rahman blending canny soundtrack choices and mood-enhancing original music. All were rewarded with Oscar nominations but lost out to ""The Social Network"". Meanwhile, the dazzling cinematography of Enrique Chediak & Anthony Dod Mantle was undeservedly snubbed by the Academy.All in all, ""127 Hours"" is a highly compelling film graced with superlative production values and a top-notch lead performance. The only drawback is that the film's conclusion is never in doubt, seeing as how the movie is based on an autobiography.

Since I've waited such a long time to see it there was no way I was going to miss it! I even dragged a friend along who doesn't often see this sort of thing. I'll give you my thoughts after this very brief summary (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please try to shift that rock while I write the next paragraph).Aron Ralston is an adventurer, mountain climber, he's most at home with all outdoor types of activities. He feels he doesn't have to rely on anyone else and has cut himself off from his friends and family to concentrate on the things he likes to do. Little does he know this is going to cost him dear. He goes out canyoneering alone near Moab, Utah but doesn't take his mobile phone (or cell phone if you prefer) with him and doesn't tell anyone where he's going. There he meets two girls, Kristi and Megan and they have a bit of fun jumping into a pool below a crack in the rocks. Eventually they go their separate ways and Aron heads off alone again. Taking a route seldom used he causes a rock fall that leaves him trapped, pinned by the arm with a large boulder. He is there for 127 hours before he uses desperate measures to free himself. During this time he reflects on the mistakes he's made in his life, making a video diary he thinks will be his legacy. I'll leave it there so as not to upset the squeamish Spoiler Police.I thought this was a very well made film with several devices used to keep the audience interested. Split screens, flashbacks, dream sequences all keep the thing moving along nicely. I have to say it's an outstanding performance from James Franco as Aron Ralston, he really nailed it! Honourable mentions also go to Kate Mara as Kristi and Amber Tamblyn as Megan.I love the visual style used by Danny Boyle in this one. It could have been a tough gritty drama like the 2003 Kevin Macdonald film Touching the Void, (also a very fine film by the way) but I found it was a lot more than that. It will make you cringe, it will make you laugh, and it will even make some of you cry, but I found it very engaging and very enthralling (even though I knew what the final outcome was)__ Definitely recommended.PS My friend thought it was good but a bit padded out with all that hallucinating & stuff (His words, not mine).My Score: 8.6/10 ","  know  April already   film came    UK  January,     long wait   finally landed   local cinema!   waited   long time  see    no way   going  miss !  even dragged  friend   doesn't often see  sort  thing.  give   thoughts    brief summary (summary haters,    don't wish  know   plot, please try  shift  rock   write   paragraph).Aron Ralston   adventurer, mountain climber,    home   outdoor types  activities.  feels  doesn't   rely  anyone else   cut     friends  family  concentrate   things  likes  .

When you really look back at all the things you have done, no matter how small, does it lead you to a destined path? There are those people who end up in drastic situations and near death experiences which make them think about life from a different perspective. Then you have those who are given that chance to think about life while playing the waiting game, or if you would rather call it, the holding onto hope game. I'd say 127 Hours is a bit of both. James Franco plays Aaron who gets stuck down below a crevasse with a hard rock and a difficult spot. The focus of the film is on him and once he gets himself into the situation, you know what is going to happen after; getting out. But it is not that simple. You feel the experience he is in, the hopelessness yet determination to not give up. With his trusty camera with him, psychologically he stays alert through filming himself, playing scenarios that almost serve as a light comedy, while also remembering memories of his parents and his ex girlfriend.Danny Boyle made a terrific and moving film with Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours brings us into the fear of being trapped in the middle of nowhere. If any of us was in this situation, would you have the guts to do what Aaron does? Would you give up and admit defeat or is your willingness to live strong enough so that you might appreciate life more afterwards? These are questions only you can answer.The isolation and loneliness are captured perfectly through the eerie yet beautiful cinematography of the landscape in Roobers Roost, Utah. The scene which everyone talks about is of course the cutting off the arm scene. Now, if this scene had absolutely no music, it would not have been a huge ordeal and I could have easily sat through it while sipping a cup of tea. But the music really gives it an edge and it is like it is making you feel the pain at the same time, and while it doesn't last long, it stings, so I can see how audiences have been reacting to this. Seeing the images of Aaron's face with blood and a horrific look on his face was enough to make me feel chills.This is a simple tale of survival, but it is one in which it is real because Aaron is not made out to be a hero or anything; he is simply just a normal man who has a will to live and to fix up the mistakes he has made in his life. The thing I liked about it is that you discover who this man is and it wastes no time in building his character up __ the first twenty minutes pretty much gets to the point of where the plot should go. While Aaron is thinking about his life while trapped down there, you contemplate his life with him. You understand that he feels that he got himself down there through his choices in life __ it will make sense when you watch it in how he comes to the conclusion that it is his fault due to the fact that he chose to be alone in life. You also understand why he has to cut his arm off, because when given little alternative besides death, there is no choice.It makes you wonder about the people you take for granted in life. Small things such as letting them know we are alright and telling them where we are. Because you never know when there is a time in your life when telling someone what you are doing can change everything for you. It just makes you think about that a little harder, and in this day of age when it is so easy to let people know via a text where we are, why not use it so people can have a peace of mind?

In April of 2003 Aron Ralston found out what he was made of, literally and figuratively. While Aron was trekking the rocky terrain of ""Blue John Canyon"" his luck ran out and fell due to a loose boulder which crushed and trapped his arm against the rock wall. His story is one of hope, triumph, terror and sheer determination. The perfect setting for an intensely satisfying movie experience. Thankfully, director Danny Boyle delivered this in spades.""127 Hours"" is a full feature film about this tragic but conquering incident. Aron Ralston, an avid climber and hiker, played by the talented James Franco, made the near fatal mistake of not telling anyone where he was going. Ralston sets out to his ""home away from home"" and meets a couple of less experienced hikers looking for some adventure. He takes them to a beautiful spot where they enjoy a brief swim, though this section is not factual to the real experience. Afterward, Ralston continues his trek and ends up, as the real Aron Ralston named his book, stuck ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"". What follows is his incredible journey to free himself, rappel a 65 foot rock wall and hike over 8 miles to finally be rescued in one of the most emotional endings in a film to date.There were a lot of challenges in developing a feature length film based on Ralston's amazing story. Many wondered how director Danny Boyle would keep the audience engaged since the setting is a single place with a single character. Not to mention the fact that we all know how the story ends up. Nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Actor and Best Picture it's obvious they overcame these challenges. For one thing, the pacing is perfect as was the accompanying music. Boyle seamlessly transitioned slow dismal scenes with those of courage and optimism. This worked largely due to the variety of music used in the film. From the outstanding original score from A.R. Rahmin to the uplifting ""Lovely Day"" by Bill Withers and the surreal finale from Sigur R  s. To me it seemed like the music was an auditory way of showing his inner thoughts during the whole experience, the soundtrack was a character all it's own.""127 Hours"" is a powerful movie and story. One in which could not have been so successful had it not been for the astounding direction and cinematography. Boyle's team brought the experience of trekking the Utah canyons to life with fluid camera work. A closeup shot of Franco's hand sliding against the rock wall while navigating through the canyon is just one of many examples. Personally, I thought this film should have been not only nominated for Best Cinematography in the Academy Awards but also won. Boyle is a master of his craft and this film further propels him to the top of the list of best directors working today.I won't get into the ""meat"" of the amputation scene, but I will say that it was one of the most intense things I've witnessed in film. That is saying a lot considering the types of movies I watch and review here. Disturbingly accurate this scene was filmed in one take using multiple camera's and only one prosthetic arm. Yet another testimony to Franco's superb acting. Following the amputation scene we see more outstanding direction and cinematography as Ralston makes the final journey to his rescue. The best part about this final sequence is that we know what happens but while watching we are at the edge of our seat. We put aside what we already know and just go along for the ride. The direction causes us to be unsure if he will make it or not. That is the brilliance of ""127 Hours"" and Boyle's production team.I highly recommend this film as it is one of the best stories and film of at least the last few years. Boyle said it best and I'll end this review with his quote: ""This is a film about how precious life is. And it's only precious because of other people. It's not precious in itself, which is what we sometimes think - we think the will to survive is an individualistic thing. ... But it's actually connected to other people. And that's what the life essence is really about - it's always about other people, even in the loneliest places."" - Danny Boylehttp://cinemapat.blogspot.com/2011/03/127-hours-danny-boyle-2010.html "," One fateful day   canyons  Utah  lone climber fell   worst predicament    imagined.

127 Hours,709,jpschapira,28/Feb/11,8,1.7481851575266e-15,film movie one not story good will even can life characters love make just makes movies director little new never great two only first also world without people something big real tale family doesnt sense character man get really screen cinema seen music moments might,0.0,3.0,inf,inf,inf," ""If I believe__there's more than this"", sings Dido, that forgotten British lady who gave us great hits and beautiful songs such as ""White Flag"" and ""Here With me"". She always had a lovely voice, but these words she's singing in the name of Aron Ralston, the man who got his hand caught in a huge rock while climbing in the John Blue Canyon in Utah. We know who Aron is in a heartbeat; that is, James Franco defines the character in a couple of scenes. This he does not by speaking, but by actions: singing freely, running wild. Aron meets two girls and they sense he could be from another galaxy. He cares about nothing, he has not another person in mind and what he needs and loves is in front of him: big mountains.That's also what Danny Boyle needs. The mountains and James Franco are sufficient elements to make a whole movie. On the other hand, I think that by now we can agree that Boyle (alongside writer Simon Beaufoy) loves to inspire these days. That's what ""Slumdog Millonaire"" was and what ""127 hours"" is: inspiring (and inspired __I might say this a lot, but it's true-) filmmaking. If the previous film was about impossible love and rising above the circumstances to achieve the impossible, this new tale is the same thing, without the ""love"" factor. That is the factor that allowed Boyle to tell ""Slumdog"" as a fable, with hopeful music, bright colors and beautiful little things (or moments) in the ugliest places. For those who thought this was an erroneous decision, disrespectful towards a country's reality, ""127 hours"" arrives to prove them wrong.There's no embellishment here. No other color than James Franco's pale face and the red blood that comes out of his trapped arm. As real as a man who struggles for his life, with no water and food, begging for some sunlight and the response of a raven, the tale __while never losing track of its tragic center, that Boyle and the master Anthony Dod Mantle try to represent through various 'desperate' shots, like Aron's tongue seen from the inside of a bottle of water and other camera and mise-en-scene resolutions- takes flight through imagination.In Aron's situation, in which he tries to rise above the impossible as he thinks about who he is and what he's done in life (painfully- ""every moment since the day I was born has brought me to this rock"", he whispers-), imagination can be nothing but poetic (it's hard to accept it, but poetry in cinema __visual, narrative poetry- can be boring, really boring __not always-. Boyle makes it inspiring. I started with that statement so I'll try to get back to it). Aron searches for moments in the past, he envisions people in the dark and meticulously reconstructs a near future. Poetic means inexistent piano melodies in the air, or a beautiful woman saying an ""I love you"" that no one can hear. Some of the things he experiences are otherworldly.The most recent movies about characters alone with the world were Sean Penn's ""Into the wild"" and Rodrigo Cortes' ""Buried"". The first movie is about a boy who has lived a lie and decides to find truth in standing alone in front of Mother Earth. His personal story has affected him, and before he's completely by himself, he changes (willingly or not; it doesn't matter, it just happens) the lives of the people he meets. Chris (or Alexander Supertramp) has an ideology and talks a lot about it, but it's not the most consistent element of the movie. In ""Buried"", ideology is everything, powered by a great original idea. A man is trapped in a coffin, underground, and as he tries to survive (there are some good 'survival' sequences), every line of dialogue is spoken to criticize the government. There's no personal story whatsoever, only daggers thrown at the policies towards hostages in foreign land.Let's recapitulate, because I want to get to the transparent inspiration that lies in the story of ""127 Hours"". In ""Into the wild"", Supertramp ends up alone in Alaska by personal choice. You can be inspired by several reasons that can be found in the journey of the film (a road trip in the end), even more if you believe in the character's ideas. In ""Buried"", the main character is captured on purpose. You can be inspired if you support his political ideas, his will to get out of that coffin or his family waiting at home? There's not real inspiration there.In ""127 Hours"", however, Aron being trapped is not planned (this is all the more surprising), but as he goes back on who he is, at some point he even believes it was not an accident. It's that idea what's inspiring. Aron spends 127 hours revising these thoughts. He rediscovers himself as a person and we get to know him as a man who wants to overcome the impossible. What's even more purely inspiring, besides the fact that Boyle fractures the screen and races through the scenery in order to make this introspective journey more exciting (as only himself can); besides the fact that the director has found in A.R Rahman the perfect partner to tell stories that cannot live without music (now without HIS music); and besides the fact that James Franco takes on the role as if it was his own life on the screen; is that unlike a lot of these kinds of movies, Aron does what he does not to prove a point, or to set an example, or because he stands for something. He does it for himself because he wants to. In those hours, he somehow realizes he has to do it. Well__that's when nothing can stop you.

I always thought it was an amazing story that would inevitably be turned into a film. I was very excited to see this movie.It was absolutely brilliant. The direction from Danny Boyle is so abstract and interesting. He utilizes sounds and external images to really build up a lot of tension, suspense and emotions, which contribute to the overall story so well. It really is a well made film. Danny Boyle knows exactly what to do with the story he has, and exactly how to make that story into something beautiful. The majority of the story takes place in an isolated area, in the middle of nowhere, so for majority of the film we are closed in with James Franco's character, and tightly involved with everything that is happening around him. It is a claustrophobic feeling but one that is very effective.Boyle knows what to do with his time as well. You think that 90 minutes of a guy trapped in canyon wouldn't be the most exciting thing, but the adrenaline that gets pumped through your body as you are watching this film is amazing. I think this is due to the fact that most people know exactly what is coming, and Boyle has identified this and played it against his audience to bring them an intensified story about the strongest thing in the universe. The will to live.James Franco is absolutely superb as Aaron. What a brilliant actor. His struggle is so purely and naturally shown and the moments when all seems to be lost is very expressly shown from Franco. You can tell that he was very passionate about this role and that he poured his heart into this story. I can imagine how hard it would of been, acting in the same position and same area for basically the entire film, but Franco has pulled of the performance of his career. I'm very torn between tipping him or Colin Firth for the Oscar now. Very different performances, but most definitely at the same caliber.Some of the scenes are absolutely gut-wrenching and the climax is not one for the weak-at-heart. I myself found it hard to watch the climax, and I have to admit that I felt almost light headed in these scenes. But I loved what Boyle did with the build up to this climax and I felt that the gore was 100% necessary and a prime example of when gore is used in a brilliantly effective manner.Danny Boyle is without a question, one of my favorite directors and I think he has truly made a masterpiece with this story.

A trailer for Sanctum (2010), the forthcoming James Cameron-produced underwater cave-exploration adventure, precedes 127 Hours: Danny Boyle's first feature since Slumdog Millionaire (2008). The same motif of entrapment stemming from lone attempts at glory fills much of Boyle's work. The results are shown in Shallow Grave (1994), Salim's demise in Slumdog, and Richard's attempts to outfox Sal in The Beach (2000). In some ways, the surreal realities of Trainspotting (1996) and 28 Days Later... (2002) turn this on its head, with the character needing to escape, towards a civilised community.However, it isn't the setting so much that's the appeal with this theme of being trapped in small spaces, but more the character's coping with the event. Aron Ralston (James Franco) is an adventurer. Fearless, enthusiastic and resourceful, it seems that he doesn't need anyone __ it's this that becomes the premise for what's to come. How far does being a loner, in spite of your own resourcefulness, really get you? It's difficult not to draw reference to the political climate. A glimpse of Ralston's boss's t-shirt tells us ""They can't lay us off if they can't find us"". Boyle himself has maintained lifelong Labour sympathies, which can account for the focus on community (or the lack of it) that drives the film. In a life or death situation, Ralston comes to realise that resourcefulness and will might prevail, but that individualism landed him there. 'Checking in' now and then might have avoided the whole fiasco.This is typical Boyle fare from the outset, exhibiting an MTV-style montage of soda, beer, and fast-food. It works as a kind of visual ""Choose life..."" The gore (for which a fair amount of the audience are here primarily to see) is near-meticulous in it's attempts to qualify this as surgery: the camera constantly returning the severing of the nerve. These fast paced cuts of close-up, which include a number of unnecessary microscopic scenes of water, perspiration, urine leaving their points of origin, recall to some extent moments of terror in 28 Days Later. It's visceral soundtrack (scored by A.R. Rahman of Slumdog) and (akin to Cillian Murphy's desperate hero) Franco's intensity supports this. Not short of new, more technically demanding ways to visually show the vastness of middle-American desert, Boyle's never been one for allowing his audience time to contemplate - this is what distinguishes Sean Penn's understandably compared, but superior, Into the Wild (2007).What Slumdog offered the viewer in terms of a rarely transmitted, transcultural showpiece, was marred slightly with clich Ã. High-octane throughout, 127 Hours amalgamation of contemporary media phenomenons, while subtle in its assessment of the Western socio-political landscape, doesn't feel quite so important. Franco will quite rightly earn praise to add to his growing repertoire for his portrayal of the all-American wanderer. Boyle on the other hand - following a church floor covered with the walking-dead, the brutal blinding of a slum child, and now a severed limb left somewhere in the Utah desert __ continues to struggle to reach the affect of Trainspotting.

127 Hours,715,ecstatic-tickle,19/Jan/11,8,7.299542924386413e-11,film movie one not good well even films time can way characters much makes little never two only see heart also entertaining without many real often sense kind action take get audience worth really far long music moments might,0.0,3.0,inf,inf,inf," Everyone who watches 127 Hours goes into the movie knowing that the guy cuts off his arm in the end__but what you might not expect is the wide spectrum of emotions and imagery that his journey to get there encompasses. The sense of discomfort waiting for *that* scene is palpable in an audience throughout the running time, but there's also the sense of discovery and life-affirming joy that the film's fantastic direction evokes.Danny Boyle brings the same kinetic energy to the material as he did with the likes of Trainspotting and Slumdog Millionaire - there's always been a confidence about his filmmaking that can either come off exhilarating or obnoxious, luckily here he strikes the former. From the opening scenes of Ralston setting off for his journey (without telling anyone where he's going I might add) Boyle employs split-screen visuals and a pumping tune to bring the audience along for the ride, as he takes with him only a few supplies and a handycam to record his trip to the desert near Moab, Utah.Franco's spirited portrayal of a thrill-seeking adventurer brings to mind the same carefree energy of Into the Wild's Christopher McCandless - another ill-fated young explorer, played by Emile Hirsch. Tearing through the desert on his bike, Ralston falls to the ground and without pausing snaps a shot of himself smiling on the ground. There are some really dynamic camera tricks, like placing the camera inside the straw as he takes a sip of water. He encounters two rather irritating girls, novice climbers for whom he serves as guide for an afternoon, taking a plunge into the rock pool with them and then going on his way.""We probably didn't even figure in his day"" the girls quip as he walks off. However, before too long Ralston is shouting their names from the fault line into which he has fallen. The moment the rock hits and he gets painfully wedged between it and the wall, bam - the title card ""127 Hours"" - a good 15 minutes into the film, a very sly move on Boyle's part. After much grunting and cursing, Ralston realises the severity of his situation, and so lays out his inventory - trying to formulate some kind of plan.He begins by trying to chip away at the rock with the blade of the cheap multi-tool he has with him. There is a moment early on when he drops the knife somewhere quite out of reach - and the audience, knowing what's coming, secretly hope that he can never pick it up. But alas, he does - and in fact attempts to sever his arm with the dull blade far earlier than you might expect, but to no avail.Ralston soon settles into a routine - recording his thoughts on the handycam every day - observing a raven that flies overhead each morning, the sunlight as it shines down into his fault line for fifteen minutes a day, and the few blissful moments he can bathe his ankle in it. Some music choices almost seem too upbeat and undercut the seriousness of the situation, Danny Boyle often (as he has in the past) places the need to keep an audience superficially entertained over the need to honour the grim reality of story.Ralston becomes resourceful in his fight for survival, constructing an elaborate pulley with ropes and connecting devices, trying with all his might to pull the rock out, but failing. On the Tuesday morning, he tapes himself hosting a kind of light-hearted TV chat show - interviewing himself about his current predicament. Entertaining as this enthusiastic schizo-dialogue might be, it stretches belief that he'd have so much energy after that many hours of dehydration.He begins to have dreams, remembering times with the French girl-that-got-away, played by the alluring Cl Ãmence Po Ãsy, and also experiences hallucinations - including a rain shower that turns into flash flood - a spectacular sequence that sees Ralston floating to freedom as the rock comes loose in the rush of water, defying audience expectation before returning to him in his actual circumstance. Some of the flashbacks and illusions are a little heavy handed, as to be expected with Danny Boyle - but for the most part serve the movie well to take us out of the confined setting.As Ralston situation becomes more dire and he seems to be facing into death, his body is drained, becoming so dehydrated that he resorts to drinking his own urine, that same camera inside the straw now rising with a yellow liquid. ""It's no Slurpee"" Franco observes ""__it's like a bag of p*ss"" Pushed to his physical and psychological limits, he makes the decision to sever his arm. He begins to have heart palpitations, and stabs himself in the arm out of frustration. Once again Boyle cuts to one of his novelty internal camera angle - this time we see the point of the blade hitting the bone. He begins breaking these bones, and it's out with the blade again - slitting skin, ripping tendons, blood everywhere - the soundtrack underscoring the pain.Despite how graphic the scene is, he's taking the necessary action to break free and it is truly a cathartic moment after so many scenes of struggle and hopelessness. Eventually, he emerges with only a red stump remaining - climbing out into the sunlight, having lost one arm - but gaining immeasurable wisdom from his experience. The struggle is over and has felt real thanks Franco's commitment to the character's plight and Danny Boyle's inventive direction. 127 Hours is an uncomfortable ride, but one worth taking, as long as you're not too squeamish.

Kind of speechless right now with what I just watched. I feel like I was trapped in a canyon with my arm stuck. Where to start.Boyle is on top of his game with this one and right away you can tell its a Danny Boyle movie. It has fast cuts, hand held camera work and a beautifully appropriate constructed soundtrack. Using all these tools he places you right in Aaron Ralston shoes, and they are not the shoes you want to be in. We are introduced to Aaron, played by Franco, getting ready for a hiking expedition and his journey as he gets there. He rides his bike 17 miles, locks it up and then hikes running into two girl hikers. He helps them on their way and shows them a ton of fun. Through the prelude here, we see that Aaron is a fun loving guy, living for the thrill of living, the rush, he just wants to be outdoors, which will ultimately put him through hell. I thought this had one of the better preludes of a film in a while, with upbeat music, beautifully shot scenery, your ready to join him yourself. It's not until a rock falls and is lodged between the canyon wall and his arm are we shown the title 127 Hours, and with Franco's terrified face. Just an awesome shot, and really all we need to see to understand what is to come.For the next Hour and fifteen minutes we are with Aaron, stuck. We are dealing with Aaron's mortality, and thus thinking of our own. From here Boyle direction and Franco's acting places you in the canyon. He uses extreme close ups on Franco's face repeatedly to instill a sense of claustrophobia and fear (this more so due to Franco's acting). There are even shots from the inside of his thermos and camel back, placing you in Aaron's mind. Imagining the water flowing to you and becoming less and less. There are few times he will use a shot that pans back from the canyon and displays the empty desert creating for the audience Aaron's loneliness and crushing reality of his surroundings. The sound was an especially well done aspect, specifically with the water. Boyle cranks up the sound of the water sloshing around in the thermos, or going through the hose in the camel back, you'll actually get thirsty while watching. While Boyle places the audience in the canyon with his direction the writing and Franco make us start to deal with our own mortality.Throughout the time in the canyon, you are constantly shown flashbacks and memories of Aaron's leading up to the event. He starts out with what we all would start with, regret about not telling anyone where he was going, what he should have brought with him, etc. As time goes on he starts to think about life, how he treated people that he loved, and what he's leaving behind. Up until the climatic vision that gives him the strength to survive. And really who wouldn't be doing this. He constantly is keeping record on his video camera, keeping his own sanity as well as the audience's. Really the whole time you are thinking that that's probably what you yourself would be doing and thinking thus really making you think about your own life.Its an extremely powerful film. Inspirational, depressing, scary, and the climax of the film is grotesquely real. Its such an unbelievable amazing true story of survival and what the human body and mind are capable of. I'd say go out and enjoy it, but I don't know if enjoy is the right word. I can guarantee that you will be moved and inspired by this film due to Boyles direction, Franco's acting, and of course the real Aaron Ralston.

Now being an Indian, I had no qualms with Slumdog Millionaire; I thought it was a good movie which deserved most of its honours. But, then again, every second Bollywood movie consists of action, drama and loads of 'masala', so Slumdog was something I'm immune to. A.R.Rahman didn't need two Oscars and the Pussycat Dolls strutting to his number for him to be proved a success. I've seen way better Bollywood actors than Anil Kapoor and we all know that Dev Patel and Frieda Pinto have built a reputation that they themselves will find very hard to supersede. Also, Slumdog Millionaire portrayed India and Mumbai, my hometown, in a negative light. I still have to explain to my Brit friends here in the UK that Mumbai does not consist of slums and that half the customer service calls they make are answered from a place that's 10 minutes from where I live.Based on the book 'Between a Rock and Hard Place' by mountaineer Aron Ralston, 127 Hours is a true story about life and how we need a jolt sometimes to wake us up to the realities that we take for granted. In Ralston's case, it was a very harsh reality that gave him overnight popularity but the ordeal that he went through for 127 Hours changed him as a person. The movies draws parallels with Castaway, or more recently with the Chilean miners in terms of the body's will to survive at any given cost. The thing that stays with you long after 127 Hours is over is James Franco. 127 Hours is a films that will transcended him from an actor with a cute face to a serious talent. Like when Leonardo DiCaprio did Titanic you knew here was a superstar in the making. Franco has been used to playing second fiddle to Spiderman, but 127 Hours is all about him! He brings believability to a character in the throes of duress. The story of Aron Ralston needed a character who could be realistic enough to watch be a carefree bird and adventurer yet bearable to watch severing his hand. Franco has the charm and the suave to be a ladies man, yet hes make you believe each of his hallucinations and makes you laugh at his pain with him during some of the deepest moments of the film. If this performance does not get him a Best Actor nod at the Oscars this year, I'll be tempted to cut off my own hand. How great will it be for an Oscar presenter to win the Oscars. I wonder when was the last time that happened!A.R.Rahman does a fabulous job again with the music. It's challenging because the music could have been dark and morose and still worked well but he works with Boyle's moods in this film turning up the grungy guitars at parts yet hitting hollow strings during its lighter moments. 'If I Rise' is a mellow composition with Dido and himself. It may not be the 'Jai Ho' that the world danced to, but it talks about resurrection within its serene atmospheres, which is the main emotion of the film.Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy have outdone themselves yet again. They could have focused on the way Ralston mended his relationships or the fame Ralston achieved after he went home. Yet they chose to keep the film simple. There are barely any secondary characters, yet it is the emotional journey of a man who believes in life. 127 Hours is a story about living and that's exactly how they have panned it out. The shots are mostly close-ups focusing on the emotions of the character and the scenes where he amputates his arm have been done exactly as they may have been done in real life, nothing made 'aesthetic' for the sake of dramatization. When you leave the theater, its like you actually went through that ordeal and few films leave you with that feeling. True, it may have been claustrophobic at times, but thats exactly how they wanted it to be. You could literally feel his pain, his anguish, his despair, his loss and his hope and for that all credit goes to Danny Boyle and James Franco.

127 Hours,719,Dan Franzen (dfranzen70),09/Jan/11,9,1.2701177513300268e-08,film movie one not good even films life much make just makes movies director look new great see also performance big real sense feel year kind man get audience isnt right,0.0,3.0,inf,inf,inf," 127 Hours is one of those infrequent movies that makes great use out of its limited resources; in this case, its space. It's about a hiker, played by James Franco, who finds himself partially trapped by a rock, pinned against the wall of a crevasse. It's a stunning, visually visceral film with a couple of gut-churning scenes, but overall it is a magnificent, evocative thriller.Franco is Aron Ralston, a thrill seeker who loves, loves, loves the desert around Moab, Utah. And with good reason; the aerial shots give a terrific sense of just how isolated and beautiful the area is. He's hiking the Blue John Canyon when he runs into inexperienced hikers Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn), whom he cheerfully helps get back on track. It's shortly after departing from the young ladies that Aron, descending into a small fissure, slips, dislodging a medium-sized boulder, which inconveniently lands on his right arm, pinning it against the rock wall.Throughout Ralston's ordeal, he reexamines his life and concludes that he's in his position because of his own decisions, and not just the one in which he neglected to tell anyone of his whereabouts. ""All my life I've been heading toward this rock,"" he thinks; his new insight leads him to conclude that he's let a lot of opportunities slip by in his selfish quest to do things on his own.The movie is based on a real-life occurrence, so it's probably no spoiler to learn that the young man does somehow survive his predicament. But it's not that result that makes this so captivating. Even if you've learned beforehand just how Aron is able to extricate himself, the scene is intense, grisly, and tough to watch. It's the kind of scene that makes you want to look away and ahead at the same time.A lot of the film's success depends on Franco himself. Like Ryan Reynolds last year in Buried, Franco is front and center; it's all about Aron, his past and present, and the lack of mobility means much must be told through Franco's expression and one-armed activities. And he's up to the task. Franco's performance here must have been physically excruciating in and of itself, as much of the cavern scenes were filmed in one sitting. But he also brings quite a bit of emotional tension to the role, and I wouldn't be surprised if he managed to get an Oscar nom out of it.The film does have its flaws. One problem in mysteries and other thrillers is the pull-the-rug gambit, wherein the filmmakers make the audience think A, then switch to B, then repeat ad infinitum. After a while, the viewer isn't sure what's real and what they're supposed to think. Here, director Danny Boyle does trick you a few times; is what Aron sees a hallucination, or is it real? Aron makes quick video recordings while trapped, documenting his efforts. This adds more realism (how else would we know what he's done?) and engages the audience. It also allows us to see all sides of the young man; show-off, extrovert, implacable logician, terrified prisoner. Aron's epiphanies are so vivid that we feel as terrible as he does.But there's a big upside to that realism. When the (obvious) ending does come, the result is so cathartic that it's unlikely that an average viewer could be unmoved by it. The emotional buildup during the course of the movie is justified by a denouement that just blew me away.

I've seen this film twice and I really loved it both times. I never heard about this story before I heard about the film which a first for me. The plot is basically a guy called Aron Ralston who goes hiking in Utah and while hiking he falls when trying to decent into Blue John Canyon and his right hand gets trapped by a boulder which follows him when falling.This film had me on the edge of my seat as it was very gripping. I thought this film was powerful and extraordinary. I didn't watch the scene where he cuts off his hand the first time round because i don't like blood; The second time round, I was perfectly fine. I am a bit of a screamer type of person. James Franco gives a great performance as Aron as he is a really good actor and I think he is extremely good-looking. I also think that Danny Boyle was great directing the film as he kept the scenes of him stuck with the boulder going by adding the hallucinations and flashbacks that he suffers. His flashbacks that shows his past definitely show that he regrets what he has done in the past. Some of them flashbacks made me feel a bit emotional and they have made me think that I should appreciate what I have got in life. I also loved the music that was used in the film. I also loved his facial expressions in some scenes. He just made me giggle. I am totally in love with him now. I think Danny Boyle and James Franco should have won at award/Oscar this year for their performances within the film as 'Best Actor' & 'Best Director'.I were deeply shocked that film didn't get any awards. I actually bursted out in tears at the second time round of happiness and joy as he gets out of the canyon and gets rescued.

Starring James Franco and Amber Tamblyn. Screenplay by Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy. Directed by Danny Boyle. Rated R.""127 Hours"" is an extraordinary motion picture, a cinematic profile of courage, determination and the will to live no matter what the cost.What is most amazing is that it is based on a true story. In 2003, mountain climber Aron Ralston goes canyoneering alone outside of Moab, Utah.An accident wedges part of his arm under a boulder and he is unable to free himself until he resorts to very desperate measures.As portrayed by James Franco, Ralston is somewhat of a hot dog __ a loner and a somewhat irresponsible. He takes off for the wilderness without letting anyone know where he plans to climb. He also forgets to take his cell phone.But he is a happy camper who enjoys trekking through the various crevices and byways of the canyons on his own,That solitude also is his downfall for when he has his accident, he has nowhere to turn nor any means of communicating his predicament to anyone.Franco gives a superb performance of a young man who, though impulsive, also is organized. With the exception of his cell phone, he packs all the gear he needs for what he believes will be a one-day excursion.Director Danny Boyle opens the film with a montage of crowds and crowds of people hustling and bustling through their day.He presents a frenetic, always on the go world. It is one Ralston is part of, but will soon leave for the comfort and stillness of the canyons.One of Doyle's most impressive images is in showing how alone Ralston is after he becomes trapped. The vast emptiness around him swallows up his screams for help. T(spoiler alert) The sequence where Ralston performs the necessary surgery to extricate himself is graphic and may make some queasy. It also is shot in a restrained manner. Doyle does not exploit the moment for shock value __ that is not his intention.What he does convey though, is the necessity and sacrifice one must make for survival.""127 Hours"" is a tour-de-force for Franco and Doyle. Both deserve Academy Award nominations in their respective categories, as does the picture in general.It is one of the best films of the year, a gritty and triumphant inspirational story of one man's indomitable will to live despite the slimmest of odds.Bloom is the movie critic and Blu-ray/DVD reviewer for the Journal & Courier.

Aron realizes that he has to make the toughest decision of his life: Die there sad and alone regretting his selfishness to his family or cut his arm off with a cheap pocketknife and have his redemption. No one knows where he is, he has no phone (which even if he did he would have no signal). All he has is a cheap pocketknife (which I already mentioned), rope, a carabiner, a camera, some batteries, a camel back with no water in it, and a bottle with only a few milliliters of water. So pretty much Aron is screwed.Only a few hours before his incident Aron met two women hiking in that canyon. There names are Megan and Kristi. For all Aron knows these two people could be the last people he ever sees.As Aron is in that dip he has a whole lot of time to think about all of his decisions. He films him self in that dip with his camera and tells about his regrets. He regrets that he never returns his mom's calls. He regrets that he went to that canyon that weekend after he promised his sister that he would rehearse with her for her wedding. Aron comes to realization that all of this was his fault, that this boulder had been waiting for him an the only way to have his redemption and get a new life is to cut his arm off.WARNING: Do NOT read the following paragraph if you haven't heard this story of Ralston already! It contains spoilers.That cheap pocketknife Aron has is what saves him, because in the third act Aron makes the decision to cut the arm off. Aron lives and has a happy life from there on, although he has to walk miles without an arm before he finds people to help him. He fixes all the messed up decisions he made and gets that redemption I've been talking about.This film is nothing less than spectacular. Boyle's incredible direction plus the amazing performance by Franco make this a masterpiece. But if you want to see this movie you have to get use to Franco's face because you'll be seeing it quite a bit in this movie.Also, because there's hardly any characters the emotional depth that they the filmmakers had to put in each and every character is tremendous. And they succeeded at putting that emotionality into each and every character.This could have very boring, and I mean VERY boring. But thankfully we have Boyle who made this the most entertaining, intense, and spectacular movie of the year. Absolutely astonishing.

127 Hours,727,aschein81,12/Dec/10,9,4.289675790529733e-14,film movie one not story will well even time best can life much make just makes director little enough still never great only see first made also performance world though without people real years character feel year kind take get audience full really screen seen right dont,0.0,3.0,inf,inf,inf," ""127 Hours"" is the true story of avid mountain climber Aron Ralston (James Franco - in the performance of a lifetime here), who decided to take a spontaneous hiking trip to Canyonlands National Park in Utah one Spring day in 2003 without taking a cell phone with him and without telling anyone where he was going. Unfortunately, while hiking through a canyon well below the ground surface a boulder fell down on Ralston's right forearm, therefore trapping himself in that location. Ralston was forced to survive on one full water bottle and one day's supply of food for 5 days - before he took the drastic and incredible measure of cutting off his own forearm to set himself free. This movie is all about the art of immersing the audience with Ralston and letting us experience his psyche during the slow-paced 5 days of hell he experienced, with little to no dialogue for most of the film. Franco's performance overall is simply spectacular, and deserving of the Oscar for Best Actor (even though he probably won't get it because of his young age). The numerous close-ups of his face with his bloodshot, droopy eyes, clenched teeth, and veins popped out of his neck and forehead can only make me imagine the hell director Danny Boyle put him through while filming this movie. Boyle and Franco never wuss out when it comes to showing us the dark sides of life in the hole, as they aren't afraid to let us see large ants (real) crawling on Franco's face or him almost drowning to death during a terrential downpour that almost fills up the entire canyon one night.As Ralston, Franco shows us a character that always lived life to the extreme and could easily be described as cocky and arrogant. In the first 15 minutes of the film when he is beginning to explore the canyons, we see him arrogantly flirt with a couple of young female hikers, and later in the film during some flashbacks we see his partying lifestyle where he believed that he was basically immortal. Yet while this overconfidence and arrogance is likely the reason why he got himself trapped in his dilemma in the first place, ironically it could also be said that both of those traits gave him the emotional strength to keep fighting as the days passed by.One would think that a film like this would be either extremely depressing to watch or extremely inspirational to watch, but I personally found it to be neither. I was simply so immersed in the canyon with Franco that I felt as though I was just focused on doing whatever it took to get through the days and nights, just as he was, and that I didn't have time to feel a lot of different emotions. He's neither someone you truly root for, nor someone you root against, mostly because you don't really know much about him - it's just all about the business and strategy of trying to figure out what to do in the moment to survive. Also, I was pleased that Danny Boyle basically focused the entire movie on Ralston's dilemma in the hole with some sporadic flashbacks of memories with his families and friends, rather than adding on some kind of extra subplot with a rescue recovery team trying to find him or his girlfriend consistently waiting on the couch to hear from him back home. We see a few short clips of Ralston imagining his girlfriend talking to him, but it's all seen from the perspective of his own psyche and mental state in the hole - rather than creating scenes from a typical search and rescue plot.The film is also a very subtle analogy to America's economic meltdown in 2008, and Ralston serves as symbolism for that. Danny Boyle clearly means for people to think about this in the film, as he shows a guy in a store in the beginning for 10 seconds with a t-shirt that reads ""You can't lay me off today."" Ralston is of course an avid risk-taker who does everything he wants individually, regardless of thinking of any possibly dangerous consequences. He just takes any risk he wants in the outdoors, and never plans for anything to go wrong. It's pure individualism and risk-taking taken to the extreme. It's a very fitting comparison to our economic structure of unregulated capitalism and gambling in recent years, and how we allow individualism on Wall Street to take risks with our money on a daily basis, without any kind of ""back up plan"" in case of unintended consequences. We now see ourselves (not just the United States, but also much of the world) still struggling with the effects of our economic collapse. Perhaps we can learn from Ralston by making some changes so we have our own preventive back up plan and focus less on ""all or nothing risk-taking"" individualism so we don't have our own tragic accident like this again. Ralston clearly decides that he has had enough of it, as he makes the choice of cutting off ""Adam Smith's invisible hand"" (his hand was under the rock, so it was invisible to him), to set himself free. No more unregulated capitalism and reckless risk-taking and greed for Mr. Ralston - he has learned from his mistake.It's a shame that a movie with great acting and directing like this has only made a mere 7 million dollars after already being in release for a month now, and that it has only been released in a select number of theaters nationwide. This is terrific art to watch being created on the screen and I sure hope it ends up making a solid profit on its 17 million dollar production budget. Hopefully the fact that Franco is now co-hosting The Oscars this year will call more attention to it and get it some name recognition.

The film is directed by Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire) and written by Simon Beaufroy who based the screenplay on Aron Ralston's memoir, ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place."" From the opening scene we know we are in for a wild ride. Boyle has the audience immediately climbing the walls with pounding music and rapid fire sequences shown on split screens that display crowds cheering, people running, and a frenzy of movement, perhaps in an attempt to show the random chaos of Ralston's existence.Soon we see Ralston, an experienced hiker, speeding along on his dirt bike in Utah's Blue John Canyon in Canyonlands National Park as he undertakes in his own words, ""a capriciously impromptu vacation."" In bravura style, he doesn't tell anyone where he is going and is only equipped with a pocket knife, a bottle of water, a video recorder, some candy bars, a camera and a backpack. Presumably cell phones weren't invented at the time. Using cinematographers Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak, the beauty of the canyon has never been as vividly displayed. When Aron meets two lost female hikers (Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara), he guides them to a swimming hole shimmering in the sun where all jump in with an explosive sound and a joyous release that's palpably felt.After inviting Aron to a party on the weekend, the two hikers leave with one of them remarking that ""I don't think we figured in his day at all,"" Impatient to move on, tragedy strikes suddenly when his bike crashes into the rocks. Gripping a huge boulder to maintain his stability, he loses his balance and falls to the bottom of the canyon, his right hand pinned underneath the giant stone. Trapped and unable to move his hand, his repeated cry, ""I need help,"" signals not only his plea to be rescued but his realization about how alone he is in the world. Ralston has little water which is rapidly running out and only a small amount of food and he knows that he could die in a few days.Though we never enter any sort of dreamlike state as in Requiem for a Dream, Aron visualizes images of his life shown in super-hyped cutaways and flashbacks that recall an ex girlfriend (Cl Ãmence Po Ãsy) that he perhaps broke up with too suddenly, a picture of his sister on her wedding day, and a vision of the future in which he sees a little boy and an unknown woman snuggling close to him. Ralston spends much of his time recording his thoughts into his camcorder (the real Ralston did the same), often playfully assuming different roles.He does becomes serious, however, when he tells his mother that he's sorry he missed her last phone call and that he loves her. As each new day dawns and Ralston is at the end of his rope both literally and figuratively, he begins to realize that the only way out is to take the ultimate drastic step that you may have heard about, an act shown in a brutally extended sequence that lasts four minutes and had most viewers, including this one, hiding their eyes.Franco does an impressive job in presenting Ralston as an energetic but immature individual who enjoys travelling solo, yet we learn little about the kind of person he is, and I often felt as if I was watching a performance rather than being emotionally involved with a life or death struggle. In his desire to keep us in a good mood, Boyle ratchets up the entertainment with a jazzed up, music video style that drains the impact of the unfolding drama. Though we sense that, as a result of his ordeal, Ralston will experience a renewed connection with others, we never really learn if he fully understands deep down that his aloofness may have created the problems in his life, or if his spiritual outlook has deepened. Sabotaged by Boyle's frenetic pace, 127 Hours eliminates any contemplation of the eternal silences.

127 Hours,730,Turfseer,22/Feb/11,8,2.708867891559547e-07,film one not story well can life love make may director little still never great two only see first made also without tale family take compelling long,0.2,5.0,inf,inf,inf," I wanted to see '127 Hours' because I kept wondering how anyone can make a film about a guy who gets his arm stuck under a boulder while hiking in the desert and then has to cut it off. Not only was I aware of the whole concept of the film and the ending but I also was wondering how do you make an interesting film about someone who is stuck in one small place for such a long period of time.To my great surprise, '127 Hours' is a riveting tale of one man's survival in the face of certain death. How does director Danny Boyle pull it off? For starters, James Franco is a brilliant casting choice to play Aron Ralston, the daredevil hiker who ends up between a 'rock and a hard place'. Franco is an immensely likable fellow who conveys Ralston's reckless and devil may care attitude that leads him to his date with destiny. When Ralston meets the two female hikers and escorts them to an underground grotto where they go swimming, Boyle uses that scene to reinforce our perception of Ralston as a daredevil, who risks his own life (as well as the lives of two strangers) as he seeks one more thrill, sliding between a crevice, and diving into the grotto, from a distance that an ordinary person would consider to be unsafe.The incredible thing about '127 Hours' (and I found this out after I watched the film) is that almost everything that we see actually happened. Ralston did have a video camera and filmed himself while his arm was stuck under the rock. And the video camera that was used in the film, was also the actual camera Ralston used when he was trapped! Boyle builds the tension simply by documenting everything that happened. At first Ralston believes he can move the rock through sheer strength. When that fails, he tries to be more calculating by using a pocket knife to chip away at the rock but soon discovers that plan is completely ineffectual (adding to the tension is the scene where Ralston drops the knife and must retrieve it by attaching a bent wire and guiding it down to where the knife has fallen, by placing the wire between his toes).Calling upon his survival skills, Ralston then designs an elaborate pulley system, hoping he'll be able to lift the rock, by using the weight of his body to move it. Finally, when that fails, he must concentrate on conserving the little water he has left, and figure out some other plan to extricate himself from his dire predicament. Boyle switches things up by introducing scenes in which Ralston begins hallucinating. In one such harrowing scene, after a cloud burst above in the desert, water cascades down into the crevice where Ralston is trapped, and he sees himself drowning. In another hallucinatory scene, Boyle introduces some comic relief by having Ralston imagine himself as a game show contestant, mocked by canned laughter due to his short-sightedness in failing to tell anyone where he was going.As to the amputation itself, I was relieved it wasn't as gruesome as I had anticipated. Actually, it was more fascinating than terrifying. In an earlier scene, Ralston discovers that he is unable to sever his arm using his small dull knife. Later, however, he figures out that he must break his arm in two places and then use the plier part of his knife kit to literally grind and twist until he cuts off his arm.As a result of this life changing event, Ralston has the epiphany that he had taken his family and friends for granted. Visions of the family and friends appear during the denouement and at the very end, Ralston himself, swimming in a pool, without his prosthesis, This of course suggests that the amputation has not squelched Ralston's love of the outdoors and taste for adventure. But one thing is for sure: when he takes a trip, he'll never again fail to tell those he is close to, where he is going.The cinematography and the editing is superb here in both the expansive exterior shots and in the claustrophobic area where Franco maneuvers. True, '127 Hours' is basically a carbon copy of a true event, but Director Danny Boyle manages to take a story where we already know the ending and still made it gripping and compelling. That, of course, is no easy feat! ","  wanted  see '127 Hours'   kept wondering  anyone can make  film   guy  gets  arm stuck under  boulder  hiking   desert     cut  .

OK, got that off my chest. Anyways, as I write this review, I'm listening to the song at the start of the movie, called ""Never Hear Surf Music Again"" by the Free Blood. Worth a listen, search it on you-tube. But anyway this was from beside the point of how much I love and recommend this movie to everyone living on planet Earth right now.I saw the movie with high expectations and was disappointed that it wasn't over 2 hours long, but the movie made up for that because the pacing was good and it felt right. The intro to the movie is going to be on my top ten movie intros of all time, reaching in at number 1. For now. The song worked so well and naturally every song and score in this movie worked perfectly, even if it felt out of place at times, which also felt in place! At the same time! Like I said, I am listening to the intro song as I write this. It's so addicting! 127 Hours is the story of Aron Ralston's life-changing experience in 2003 which was news nationwide. He even won person of the year awards. But the story goes that he goes on this canyoning trip somewhere in Utah and while there, he meets two girls that he spends some time showing them around the place because they're lost. After they mingle and leave, he's invited to a party setup by them and he accepts. So he continues to trek for the rest of the day around Utah's beautiful rocky caves.Unfortunately, one open gap leading down into a cave decides his fate for the next few, long, painful days. Aron decides to go on further between the narrow cave gap, and the rock he tested by stomping on it to see if it will fall, falls on him and sends him down the cave, making his arm stuck in the process. After he realizes he's screwed beyond belief he tries to make the best of it, tries to keep himself calm and tries not to think of the worst.Given that he's an engineer, he tries to salvage as much water as possible to survive for the next 127 hours. The only thing he regrets the most? Not leaving a note (which he does now in real life). At the start of the movie, you can hear a phone ringing, and when it goes to voice message, it's his mother saying hi. So, he regrets not picking up the phone because he could have told his mother where he was going, and that would have been his salvation ultimately.After realizing that mistake, the fun begins. He has visions of his past in his youth with his family and events that he thinks lead him to his unfortunate fate. But he tries not to go on the Karma route explanation because he doesn't believe in fate, neither do I. He believes that life is what you make of it, and so do I.So, he does what he can to survive in this entrapment he's in for the next few days. As days pass by, he keeps on hoping and dreaming that he'll free himself, but all his attempts fail. He even has hallucinations of the freedoms he once enjoyed before being in the position he was in. It's like the director actually wants you to believe that there's no hope. But there is. He has a solution which failed before, but not again. He wants to cut off his arm to break free from the trap he's in.Let me tell you, not a pretty scene to watch, but he cuts off his whole arm and breaks free from the grip. He eventually gets an emergency airlift and he is re-united with his family and friends once again. There is a brief cameo from the real Aron Ralston just after the end of the movie. This movie is what happened to the real Aron Ralston back in 2003 and that's why he won so many awards, because of the many obstacles he overcame at impossible odds that not many would sacrifice to get freedom the way he did.And I can't help but think how awesome would it be if Chris Mccandless still lived today; what he would say to Aron Ralston, or better yet, to put them in a room together interviewing each other, becoming great friends and take a canyon trip and record their journey. It would be like two titans coming together, a meeting of the minds. If you don't know who Chris is, then please read the book ""Into the Wild"" or watch the movie, or do both.Anyways, I now depart and hopefully you've enjoyed my thorough review of 127 hours.

All he had with him was a blunt multipurpose pocket tool, less than a liter of water, a watch, a video camera, a camera, car keys, rope, a sparse amount of food, a harness and the undeniable will to live. The love for his parents and his determination to survive alone drove him to victory. Together award winning director Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire"") and actor James Franco (""Spiderman"", ""Milk"") have recreated this tale of determination in order to show the world the meaning of the films tagline which states, ""There is no force on earth more powerful than the will to live."" Danny Boyle's cinematic masterpiece will touch and inspire everyone in one way or another. Through flawless cinematography, Boyle documents the five-day struggle of Ralston as he learns about himself and teaches the audience to never give up. Boyle teams up with writer Simon Beaufoy to produce the brilliant adaptation of Aron Ralston's book, ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" that lights the fire for James Franco's performance. Franco has the best performance of his career with his flawless, heartfelt portrayal of Aron Ralston. Franco reveals the anguish and the revelations that Ralston felt while being helplessly trapped by the power and the magnificent forces of nature. Franco's performance shined the brightest in the most powerful scene in the film. After being trapped for five days he realizes that he had no other choice than amputating his own arm with a dull blade to survive. Franco captures the pain that Ralston felt during this excruciating moment leading to his eventual rejoice and relief. Franco's humbling performance is destined for numerous excellence in acting awards and will bring him to the forefront of the Oscar race for best actor. A performance that has caused audiences to cringe and give standing ovations to what may be the best film of the year.The film really is perfect and is not weak at all. However, since there isn't anything about the film I want to use this section to warn those with weak stomachs that in multiple showings of the film there have been people that have fainted because of the realistic self-amputation scene. Don't let this dissuade you from seeing the film, because the film is by far the best film of the year. Just be ready to look away or cover your eyes during this scene. Just follow Aron Ralston's advice, ""You just have to remember that everything will be okay.""Aron Ralston grew up in the city of Denver and attended Cherry Creek High School. He was just another ordinary thrill seeker who was thrown into an extraordinary situation and the greatest challenge of his life. I recommend to see this film now immediately and as many times as you can. We all need to learn something from this story concerning the importance of priorities because when it comes down to life or death the most important things in ones life are realized. Aron Ralston exemplifies this with his emotional statement, ""Mom, Dad I haven't appreciated you as I know that I could. I love you guys and I will always be with you.""

He made the mainstream media cycle telling about his triumphant story of being trapped under a boulder for 5 days (127 hours) and escaping by amputating his own arm. 127 Hours is the telling of this story, and I feel like the only more intense way to experience the events of this film would be by being Aron Ralston himself. It is one of the most visceral and intense experiences I've ever witnessed to this kind of prolonged extent on screen. Before going on this hike, Ralston told nobody where he was going, and so when he got his arm trapped under that boulder, he knew there was hardly any way out. He suffered through increasingly gruesome things to keep himself alive, all leading up to the grisly amputation of his own arm, which is shown in its horrendous entirety in the movie, not holding back at all. However, it is a fair trade since he escaped the inescapable with his life, and continues to hike and mountain climb today. The story of Aron Ralston is miraculous and inspiring, and 127 Hours does it justice ten times over.Only the first ten to fifteen minutes of the film have Aron safe and untrapped, and the movies title doesn't even appear until after being trapped by the boulder. Needless to say, the majority of the film is just Aron Ralston, and thank God he is played by the incredibly talented James Franco. Franco's performance is one of the best I've seen in a long time because of just how demanding it is. Few actors can carry a film by themselves, but Franco does an amazing job all alone at the bottom of a crevice. The dialouge is limited save for a couple of scenes, but Franco never lets up in his performance and does so much with so little, which is really the biggest triumph of the film in its entirety. That being its ability to do so much with such limited resources. And so much of that credit goes to a brilliant lead actor whose ability soars above and beyond any solo role of this sort in a long time.James Franco can't get all the credit though. A film that takes place with one man at the bottom of a two foot wide crevice has to retain life, energy, and variety, and with a director like Danny Boyle, it does just that. Boyle is a master of the sharp edits and quick cuts, and he puts this talent to full use for 127 Hours. He has to, or else this film would have deteriorated quickly into something very tiring and boring. But Boyle's fresh visual flair keeps the film extremely lively the whole way through, and one scene after another drew me in closer and closer. I was never bored by this film, and I never felt like I wanted it to hurry up and get to the point. Every scene has a point. It's an engaging character study of Aron Ralston, while also being a piece of art. Boyle employs such unique artistic technique into this film, making it a mixture of beautiful, gruesome, disturbing, and visceral. Boyle is a master at editing. Every shot and every cut of this movie is so well timed and so perfectly illustrated to make a never ending work of art that sends you through a frenzy of heightened emotion.Boyle also perfects his visual experience with excellent music selection. A. R. Rahman, the composer of Boyle's last film Slumdog Millionaire, returned to compose this film as well. Obviously the music is completely different from Slumdog but it is very fitting and makes the experience that much more intense. What we hear is aligned so perfectly with what we see on screen, giving the film an air of expert craftsmanship, as well as an innovative and original piece of art.There is so much more to this film beyond the incredible survival story we are treated to, and thats what makes it a visceral experience like no other. Everything is put together so well and not a single shred of artistic excellence is missing. I could not ask for more from a film like this that is something just so emotionally enveloping that I know I won't be able to get my mind off of it for days. It is definitely one of the best of the year so far. The only things that I think could top it that haven't come out yet are Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan, set to release December 3rd, or the Coen brothers remake of True Grit, coming December 25th. But until then, and even long afterwords, see 127 Hours, just be prepared.

I loved ""28 Days Later"" and ""Sunshine"". But the film he is most famous for, is probably my least favorite. Sorry if i go against the grain here, but i thought ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was just plain okay. It wasn't anything i would go around hootin' and hollarin' about, and it certainly wasn't something i would consider worthy of winning best picture of 2008. Never the less, he is a great filmmaker, and none of his films are ever alike. So i am glad to see that a director like him is tackling something as extraordinary as this story.I'm sure we all remember hearing this story way back when. The man who cut off his own arm to save his life. A human coyote. Asside from the story being very prolific, the question is, can you make a man trapped in a canyon by himself an entertaining picture? The answer here is both yes, and no. While the movie does a great job of explaining and making you understand his ultimate want and desire to cut off his own arm in order to survive, it didn't really create this overwhelming feeling of life. By that i mean, i didn't feeling this desirable urge for him to escape. I wasn't hoping and praying that he would be rescued like i wanted to be. Yes, the movie does create these scenarios, and they are very very good. But let's face it, with a movie like this, you want to be standing on your feet cheering your heart out from the inside.And that really is my only problem with the movie. It really isn't a big one, and it doesn't effect the movie by any means. It's just one of those things that could have been a little better.Other than that, everything else was top notch. Danny Boyle combined with his directing and incredible editing team make this journey both fast paced and emotional at the same time......something very hard to accomplish. But the thing everyone will be talking about is James Franco, who in my opinion, just gave the best performance of his life. I have always praised actors who have nothing around them to work with, and create scenes with their body movements. And James Franco is one of the reasons why i support this belief. Don't be surprised to be hearing his name around Oscar season.Now onto the event that i'm sure everyone wants to hear about, and that is the final arm cutting climax. Now, i have seen some pretty down right and dirty things on film before.......and this is pretty bad. I hardly ever squirm, and i was squirming really hard. I mean, the guy cuts off his arm with a pocket knife, how do you not make it gory? Bottom Line, the movie is easily one of the best i have seen so far this year. No, i don't think this is THE best of the year, but it certainly deserves to be in the ranks of this years top 10. But this movie easily deserves numerous Oscar noms.

Directed by Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later) and starring James Franco (Pineapple Express, Spider-Man), 127 Hours sucker punches you with its ability to be both absorbing and compelling.The first thing to notice about 127 Hours is that it contains excellent editing. The opening credits illustrate this to a certain extent, but the best example comes at the peak of Aron's struggle once he's trapped and fighting for his life. His delusions begin overlapping with his memories as the screen is divided into three separate vertical segments representing how desperate and how dangerously close Aron has come to the brink of insanity.127 Hours looks spectacular, as well. The desert is a mostly dry and bleak place that no one would want to visit, but it's shown in a light here that makes it makes it look both appealing and beautiful in a way that almost makes you forget that it lacks civilization. The film does an incredible job of making you feel like you're right there in these crevices with Aron without giving the overbearing sensation of claustrophobia. Captivating cinematography makes even the most simple things like a dripping faucet and air bubbles settling in a water bottle appear like more of a spectacle than they really are.James Franco is also quite impressive. He is the only one on-screen for the majority of the film and has no one to play off of but himself. Events of his life flashing before his eyes and the decisions he should've but didn't make, Scooby Doo hallucinations, and premonitions of the future on top of his uphill battle to survive aren't only incredibly engaging but arguably some of the best scenes in the film.127 Hours is enthralling, incredibly powerful, and easily one of the best films of the year. James Franco delivers what is quite possibly his strongest and most intriguing performance to date while Danny Boyle adds another visually brilliant and superbly written film to his repertoire that is a potential award winner.

His role as Aron is gut-wrenching and charged with emotion. The various hallucinations and struggles he goes through more than convinced me that the real Aron went through the same torment. Which brings up a good question. What does it take for James Franco to get an Oscar? I asked the same thing of Mark Wahlberg in THE FIGHTER. I know there can only be one Best Actor, but WHAT. DOES. IT. TAKE? Both are talented, who infuse their roles with convincing emotions. When both actors are going through struggles, you feel it and cheer them on when they succeed. And both have played roles that are so natural and down-to-earth (with the exception of Max Payne in Wahlberg's case, but let's forgive him for that.) Second, the cinematography is astounding. Considering that most of the running time takes place with Aron trapped in the crevice, Danny Boyle and his team are at it again! Filming their scenes in dozens of new and creative ways. The best scenes I felt were the hallucinations. They were spot-on without feeling staged or fakey. There is one in particular that makes you think the movie's over, until you realize along with Aron that it's all a fantasy. Of late, I've been really impressed with Danny Boyle's work. TRAINSPOTTING was a force to be reckoned with, 28 DAYS LATER redefined the zombie genre, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE was an inspiring journey into a part of India that we rarely see outside of Indian cinema, and now 127 HOURS has us diving into the world of extreme sports (along with the perils of living life on the edge.)

Just in time, I managed to hook my elbows onto the carriage floor, while performing the can-can from the waist down. I knew I had only seconds before the unthinkable happened... and then a young French tourist with a big red rucksack hauled me inside.The point being: at no stage did I feel like I was in a Danny Boyle movie. Time steadfastly refused to hyperventilate, while reality in general resolutely failed to fracture into a series of dizzying hyperkinetic edits. No banging tunes. If I'm honest, it was just really, really embarrassing.But 127 Hours is most decidedly a Boyle picture: if being trapped underneath a rock for nearly a week must feel a trifle monotonous, you wouldn't guess it from his take on Aron Ralston's memoirs. Comparisons with Touching the Void are inevitable __ Aron's mishap even occurred the year Kevin Macdonald's film was released. Yet unlike 'Void, this is a weird sort of premise for an action film, in which the subject is Standing Still more often than Running and Jumping (or Crawling and Swearing). You can't blame the director, then, for wanting to jolly things along with those funny little tics of his.Ralston, played with immense conviction by James Franco, is the devil-may-care mountaineer who made headlines in 2003 after falling through a crevice and getting pinned against a canyon wall by a dislodged boulder __ truly, a destiny with density. Some might call that unlucky. Or, like the delirious Ralston, firmly believe that ""From the minute I was born, every breath has been leading me to this crack in the surface of the Earth. This rock has been waiting for me all my life."" At this stage, it probably wouldn't have been useful to point out to him that life is essentially meaningless, a bunch of random events inviting any number of feeble interpretations, and thus ultimately a bad joke played on those foolish enough to ascribe innate structure or pattern to it. That probably wouldn't have helped. All the same, we can at least entertain the notion that any and all such events present opportunities for random acts of senseless kindness __ or courage. As re-enacted in the film's skilfully-edited money shot, Ralston's sole stab at survival means rendering himself deficit to the sum of one right arm. (This reviewer's screening was at 9.30 in the morning, perhaps not the best time to catch a horribly authentic self-amputation. Then again, when would that optimum hour be?) The film is bookended by images of vast crowds __ in triplicate; the screen splitting three ways to accommodate the great churn of humanity, from whom reckless Ralston will deliberately extricate himself __ and then, in the way of Boyle movies from Trainspotting to The Beach, desperately attempt to rejoin.There's also cackling irony in the fact that while Ralston's trapped, the screen fair teems with other people, via memories of his family, past girlfriends __ even premonitory visions of a future son. If you were wondering how fellow cast members slotted into such a solitary story, they're all down there in Blue John Canyon, in James Franco's bonce. Yet strangely, he never seems so alone as during those first few moments following his extrication. Baptised in blood and sweat, he is transformed into a spirit as mighty, as elemental, but just as isolated, as that vast ancient canyon. That boulder didn't just happen to Ralston; he faced the old bastard on equal terms. And gave it the finger. ","   years ago,  boarding  tube,  missed  footing  fell down  gap   platform   train.

He tries all he can to escape, but it's not enough, until he's faced with the alternative, death. He takes drastic measures to ensure his life will prevail. I walked away from the film with one thought in my mind, could I do the same thing. Well, for one thing I wouldn't be alone, but in this situation, I would definitely try everything I could to try and get out of that situation first. Would I pass out from cutting off my own arm? Who knows, but I do know that the will to live is indeed a powerful thing. The film displays this tremendously. Beautifully shot and wonderfully edited, the film grabs you from the moments it starts and never lets you go. I was astonished to hear that some people were bored by it. Given the circumstances, I asked what did they expect from a movie about a guy who's trapped by a boulder. The real Ralston has stated that the film is as close to the real thing as anything, it could be a documentary. Another feat accomplished by Boyle and Franco, to truly capture the man in his most desperate moments. Ralston gave his seal of approval to the film and the performance, so do I.The scene in which he has to cut off his own arm is not as graphic as I expected. It surely does look real enough though. I can easily recommend this film, Boyle delivers another great film that he can add to his impressive resume. Franco gives his best performance to date.

127 Hours,746,Eumenides_0,27/Feb/11,10,1.9330925956987923e-14,film movie one not story good will even time can way life love make just makes movies new never two only heart also performance without people many real family human doesnt feel year worth full screen cinema far long isnt right music,0.0,4.0,inf,inf,inf," In a year populated with mediocre inspiring true stories like The King's Speech and The Fighter, Danny Boyle and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy give a crash course on how to film a true story with heart which lifts up our spirits, with bloody graphic details and audacity and without manipulative sentimentality. 127 Hours is a perfect movie from the opening shot to the final note of the song 'Festival' by Sigur Ros which concludes it.Aaron Ralston (James Franco) gets away from the city for a weekend to explore the canyon in Utah. He has food, water and utensils. He's a cocky expert, he's done this before many times. So many times he even acts as a guide to two girls lost in the canyon, Kristi and Megan (Kata Mara and Amber Tamblyn respectively). He knows shortcuts and cool places to visit. He's so sure of himself he doesn't even bother to inform friends or family of where he's going.Then he falls in a crevice and a boulder falls on his arm, trapping him meters below the surface in the middle of a lunar landscape barely visited by human beings. The movie chronicles his five days trapped there and his agonising escape, which involved cutting his arm with a blunt knife, climbing down a rock and walking until a family of explorers found him almost dead.So why is this predictable movie worth watching? Simple. No one makes movies like Danny Boyle, especially when he co-writes the screenplay with Simon Beaufoy, one of the finest screenwriters in the business (The Full Monty, Slumdog Millionaire).Boyle's detractors say he has an MTV style, but for me he's audacious and original in the way he plays with the camera and tries to find strange angles to shoot from. And strange angles abound in this movie. Who else would think of filming from inside Aaron's canteen to show his last drops of water entering his mouth? Who'd shoot from inside a arm to show a knife actually hitting a bone? Who would put a counter in the screen's corner showing the temperature in the cave dropping at night to show the conditions Aaron endured? And when Aaron gets trapped, who'd film, with wicked irony, an airplane flying very, very far, leaving a white trail in the air? Boyle is a madman, bless him! The camera madness starts right from the start, when the screen splits in three. This is a technique Boyle uses a lot in the movie, but the most effective use is the opening sequence. As the movie shows us Aaron preparing himself to leave his comfy apartment the split screen bombards us with images of crowds, brand names like McDonalds, traffic jams, neon lights. In one word: civilisation __ everything Aaron is leaving behind. And when Aaron arrives at the canyon the cluttered split screen gives way to wide panoramic shots of dreary landscape. The contrast is amazing! Boyle continues to prove that he's a master of visual storytelling.The movie also boasts a career-defining performance by James Franco. Franco's performance crackles with joie de vivre, enthusiasm and cheerfulness. Sure we can think, Aaron is an idiot for going out there all alone without telling anyone, he's cocky as hell. But Franco gives Aaron such a humane personality that we can't help loving him.Aaron's time trapped under the boulder allows him to rethink his life. Although perseverance is an important theme in the movie, the real emotional power comes from Aaron recognising, almost too late in his life, his selfishness and the way he treats his family and friends, and realising that wanting to do everything alone got him in there. The most heartbreaking scene comes when he imagines himself in a talk show and chastises himself for not relying on people more often.But, amidst Aaron's growth, this movie puts forth a beautiful story about the power of hope. Not since The Pianist has cinema given erected such a monument to the triumph of the human spirit. The Pianist is a difficult movie, harrowing in depicting the atrocities of the Holocaust. The protagonist, the pianist Spizlman, superbly played by Adrien Brody, faces each new day of hiding in the Jewish ghetto as a challenge. Although we can't compare Aaron's experience to his, they find common ground in their refusal to give up, in their determination to live. 127 Hours starts with the song 'Never Hear Surf Music Again,' which says 'there must be some chemical that makes us different from animals.' This can only be another grim irony by Boyle. Consider. Foxes bite their own legs off to free themselves from traps. Aaron cuts his arm off. Survival prevails over everything else. Life is beautiful but it has a price that, most of us going through our ordinary lives, ignore until we meet extraordinary circumstances.Aaron's self-amputation scene is graphic and long, but the viewers who can stomach it will be rewarded with the most sublime ending of the year. 127 Hours is the feel good of the year, a movie so emotionally draining that the ending isn't just an historical fact but a psychological necessity for the viewer desperate for closure. It's a movie that intimately and tenderly pushes us towards the protagonist. Aaron's liberation isn't just the ending of a true story, Boyle and Beaufoy make this conclusion our deepest desire. If Aaron Ralston had died, they would have had to rewrite history because no ending short of Aaron freeing himself would satisfy the viewer who grows to love him, to laugh and cry with him. And there will be tears. Tears of despair and tears of joy, especially of joy. Anyone can film a true story, but not everyone can make the viewer anxiously wait for an ending everyone already knows in advance. Danny Boyle can.

He had not informed anyone where he was headed and wasn't carrying a mobile phone either. While there, he runs into two girls who seem a tad smitten with this carefree, risk-taking, self-confident young man. Their admiration for him extends to them inviting him over to their party that's taking place later that night. Aron tells them he'll be there and heads on further.Just moments later, Aron's tryst with fate begins. While exploring a dangerous canyon drop, he trips and falls. What falls along with him is a now dislodged boulder that ends up jamming his right arm firmly against the wall of the canyon. It is the moment this happens, that the look on Aron's face (played by James Franco) changes colors instantly. This incident takes place about 15 minutes into the movie and it is then that the credits read __ '127 Hours'.Aron is now trapped hopelessly. His lung busting screams are to no avail in that uninhabited wilderness of rocks and dust. With an extremely limited supply of food and water, Aron now has to figure out a way to get out of there. He has to gather his thoughts by constantly reminding himself not to panic and carefully plan his escape. He has to figure out what he will take, and more importantly, what he will leave behind. Either he can die there with all his limbs intact or get out of there by making some tough __ extremely tough - decisions. With just a blunt pocketknife to help him make this life altering move, Aron begins his battle to stay alive.The title of the movie is essentially about two things __ one, about the duration of his ordeal in that cave and two, about the time he needed to make the choices he eventually ended up making. Somehow, the second aspect mentioned here seems the primary focus of the story. It is in these 127 hours that Aron sees images from his past, present and future as he hallucinates back and forth between his family, ex-girlfriend and friends. He records all the goings on via his digital camcorder and camera including some confessions. He even etches a crude obituary to himself on the cave's wall convinced that he'll probably not make it out of there alive. But is this really what he truly believes? Or would he rather snap his arm against the cave's wall and chop it off to break free?The film isn't violent per say yet has a beautiful poetic shade of human suffering. There is something both entertaining and tragic to watch a rational human being trapped mercilessly under a boulder. While it certainly highlights just how vulnerable humans really are, it also acts as a reminder that there is no such thing as a 'lifeless nature'. Aron's monologue as to how that boulder __ possibly a product of billions of years of formation __ was just waiting for the day the two would meet, truly highlights the core essence of the story. It is a test of his willpower in the face of nature's little gauntlet that has been thrown at him. It is also a reminder to the rest of us that nothing is ever permanent. Even something as simple as a drop of water can sometimes become the only reason for our desire to live. This reminder, more than anything else, is the true horror of '127 hours'.James Franco is brilliant as Aron Ralston. Despite the physical constraints of being stuck in one single position for most of the movie, James brings to the screen a wide plethora of emotions which make us feel with him, fear with him, empathize with him and finally, root for him. Boyle excels in this form of storytelling where a piece of rock ends up becoming such an integral part of the narrative. Visually, the film captures the rocky mountains splendidly as does the apt soundtrack by AR Rahman. It is this juxtaposition of human fragility against a product of billions of years, that makes 127 hours a memorable, relevant and inspiring watch.

When you team Franco and Boyle's talents, the results are bound to be interesting, and they are for the most part.Based on the real life story of a hiker whose arm gets trapped during one of his weekend hikes, the film delivers some strong moments, and these work mostly because of Franco's intensity. His sense of despair, anger, frustration, and anger drive the film while the director concentrates on the drama. Unlike Ang Lee and Peter Jackson who can somehow conjure magic to supplement the drama, the triple screen doesn't do much but distract from the central conflict here.On the other hand, Franco's desperate attempts at trying to find use of his resources is interesting and imaginative, and there is a scene involving a sudden flash flood that makes the audience care whether this man will ever make it out of this terrible situation. Very little time is given to the real background of Roston, and too much is spent in the ""delirium"" scenes. It's not that I am in disagreement with the sense that the hiker would have ""gone mad"" with desperation, but at times this device becomes repetitive.

127 Hours,752,Monotreme02,10/Nov/10,8,2.44561404649995e-16,film movie one not story good will well even films time best way make just makes work enough fun never two only see first made also world people ever family years human doesnt character feel year kind man compelling get audience really works seen right,0.333333333,12.0,inf,inf,inf," There are two main elements that make this story seem like it would never work as a narrative film. Firstly, everyone knows the ending. The film is based on a very widely reported true story that almost everyone seems to know about or at least heard about in passing. And so, must people go into the film knowing how it is going to end. Boyle and company faced a very major obstacle they needed to get over: how will they keep their audience interested in a story they already know the outcome of? In addition, there is the entire notion of dramatic structure. And when you have a story that takes place almost entirely with one character who has his hand stuck under a rock, your dramatic options seem relatively limited. Aside from the one major conflict that is set up very early on, there doesn't seem to be any room for development, further conflict, complications, additional obstacles, or any kind of change whatsoever. The character is quite literally and physically stuck. How do you make this compelling?Firstly, Boyle's visual style does a pretty good job at keeping us interested. Continuing his streak with Slumdog Millionaire, Boyle, along with cinematographers Anthony Dodd Mantle and Enrique Chediak create an absolutely beautiful and rich visual palette, with dynamic camera movements and angles, beautiful framing and use of color, use of different kinds of cameras for different visual styles __ consumer-grade digital cameras to get that extreme depth of field and to have objects literally pressed right up against the lens in crisp focus; wide-angle lenses, fascinating point-of-view shots and other elements that all serve to create this incredibly intense and visceral cinematic experience. The vibrant editing also does its job, with very quick, rapid-fire cuts and some of the best and most unique use of split-screen imagery I've ever seen further adding to the film's unique visual style.So how does Boyle create dramatic tension in a movie about a man who spends the entire time with his hand stuck under a rock in an isolated canyon? Easy __ he takes us out of the canyon. After the accident, which occurs fairly early on in the story, the film's linear reality begins to fragment, and we begin to see what Aron begins to see. Fascinatingly enough, the film never quite makes it clear what we are seeing are flashbacks, visions and premonitions hallucinated by Aron in his desperate situation, or a combination of the two. The fact that the film blurs these lines makes the experience all the more visceral and puts us even further and deeper into Aron's head. The dynamic style of the film as well as the extremely subjective point of view it puts us in helps to create this inescapable feeling of intensity and dread as the film progresses __ it is quite simple one of the most intense and nerve-racking films I have ever experienced. Our connection with the character is so strong and the style so inescapable that even events that we know will happen make us feel nervous and uncomfortable. You really start thinking: there is just absolutely no other way out of this situation, and as this truth becomes more and more obvious to Aron, the feeling of dread only intensifies and intensifies leading up to the horrifically graphic climax. When I first heard about this project, I didn't know if there was anything that could be done. And yet, Boyle and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy found an absolutely brilliant way to get around these problems, and ended up creating one of the most compelling films I have had the pleasure to see this year. By removing us from the canyon, the film ceases to be about a character with his hand stuck under a rock, and becomes a film about the character himself. What makes Aron tick? What happened to him to get him in this situation to begin with, and what does he have inside him that drives him to commit this insanely desperate and courageous act he commits at the end, one which my friends and I deliberated for hours whether or not we would be capable of doing, only to reach the conclusion that there is no way in the world we would be able to do what Aron did if we found ourselves in a similar situation. We see Aron interacting with other people, and pushing them away. We see him leisurely ignoring his friendly boss as he leaves the store he works at before he leaves for his hiking trip. We see him ignoring his mother's phone calls. We see him encounter and have fun with the two hiking girls, only to leave them as abruptly and as nonchalantly as he encountered them. In flashbacks, we see a past relationship Aron shared with a beautiful blonde girl when he was younger, a relationship that ended sourly after Aron wouldn't let her in. Even when we flash back to Aron's youth, we see that his relationship with his family was one of silence. Aron lives in his own world and doesn't let anyone in, and it is this rejection of other people that got him in this situation in the first place. However, it is the change he undergoes in the canyon under the rock as he begins to realize the mistakes he has made and yearn again for the human connection he has lacked all these years that gives him the strength to do what he did. And the shots of large crowds of people that bookend the film lend further poignancy to this notion of human connection that is so beautifully depicted in this amazing and inspirational true story of perseverance and survival.

This situation made Aron think about his entire life, and how he had lived it before the accident. He was a very selfish guy, who used to think just about himself, not caring about his family or friends. During the days that he was stuck, he made a reflection about his past and what he wanted to his future, what gave him strength to resist. Talking about the technical aspects of the movie, the main actor, James Franco, fits the role of Aeron. Moreover, the success of the movie has a name, and it is Danny Boyle, who I believe is one of the best movie directors nowadays. He was capable of giving a totally different aspect to the story, creatively merging images from Aron's past and future. I would say that the direction is the most brilliant thing about the movie.

His choice was a rather curious one considering the plot is about a man who gets his arm trapped in a crack of a canyon for 127 hours. The plot doesn't seem to be all that attractive and most of us were already familiar with the true story that the film is based on so there was no real room for surprises. So why has the film been nominated for Best Picture? The answer is simple; Danny Boyle is a great director who happened to cast the right man for the lead role: James Franco. Franco gives one of the best performances of the year. He is just great in this film, which is actually a one man show. 127 Hours is only about 90 minutes long, but Franco's character is trapped in the canyon with very little room for mobility from practically the very beginning (15 minutes into the movie) up to the very end. The entire film focuses on Franco with extreme close ups and his facial expressions are just all on the mark. James Franco is the reason why this film got so many great reviews and was nominated. Danny Boyle also made the film more interesting by resorting to flashbacks, daydreams, and hallucinations, but Franco is the main reason why this movie did as well as it did. I wasn't too much of a fan of Boyle's style of splitting the screen in two or three, but it was still visually stunning and the movie is worth the watch (although I disagree with the nomination for Best Picture).The movie is very faithful to Aron Ralston's autobiographical book, _ÂBetween a Rock and a Hard Place._Â The screenplay was adapted by Danny Boyle himself and Simon Beaufoy (The Full Monty and Slumdog Millionaire). It tells the true story of an arrogant mountain climber and outdoors person named Aron Ralston (played by James Franco) who goes out as he usually does every weekend after work into the Canyons in Utah. This weekend he happens to be heading towards the Blue John Canyon, and as usual he leaves without telling anyone where he is going. He is a bit of a solitary person who enjoys being outdoors with the nature and is pretty reckless. He arrives to the Canyon on Friday and on his expedition meets two girls Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn) with whom he has a good time and teaches them a thing or two about the site. Little does he know that these will be the last two people he has contact with before the accident. He parts ways with them and starts heading towards the Blue John Canyon crack. Once he arrives and begins descending the crack, a rock falls and lands on his arm, not allowing him to move. He gets stuck in the crack without being able to move the heavy rock and knowing that no one will come searching for him because he hasn't told anyone where he was heading. Aron has hardly any food and only a bottle of water to survive. The title gives away the amount of time Aron remains in the crack, and like I said there are no big surprises because we know the story, but the movie works thanks to Franco.I do not want to give away too much of the film, but most everyone is familiar with Ralston and knows what he does in order to get out (yes he escapes, because if he didn't there would be no autobiography or film so no this isn't a spoiler). I won't say how he does it in case you aren't familiar with it, but all I can say is that it is a very strong and difficult scene to watch. It was really well done and I couldn't help but cringe at the sight of it. It was a very painful scene, but Franco was excellent in it as well. He truly gives a powerful performance, and I won't get tired of repeating it. I can't believe it only took Boyle one take to get it done, it was just perfect. The reason why I'm only giving this film seven out of ten is because I really wasn't hooked by the story. Yes, I liked Franco's performance, but there was nothing new to the story. This would have made for an excellent short film, it would have been perfect, but in 90 minutes I just felt the film was stretched too long. I really didn't care too much for the daydreams or flashbacks; although they did serve the purpose of at least changing the claustrophobic environment for a while. The best scenes were actually the ones in which James Franco would tape his video journal of each day. The one where he imagines he is getting invited to an early TV show and plays the interviewer and himself is just great and proves what a good job Franco did in this movie. I recommend this movie, I just don't agree with the six Oscar nominations it received.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/ "," _       minute   born,  breath   taken,  action   leading    crack    surface._      127 Hours  Danny Boyle's latest film,   Oscar winning picture, Slumdog Millionaire.  choice   rather curious one considering  plot    man  gets  arm trapped   crack   canyon  127 hours.  plot doesn't seem     attractive    us  already familiar   true story   film  based     no real room  surprises.     film  nominated  Best Picture?  answer  simple  Danny Boyle   great director  happened  cast  right man   lead role: James Franco.

Ripping it down to its rawest form presents a very simple story about a man, Aron Ralston, who faces death in doing what he likes the most, canyoneering. This is a film that doesn't rely solely on how the film concludes. Instead, the point is embedded in the longevity of the story in the film itself. It is the experience of getting stuck in what may seem to be just a crack in the middle of a canyon, wherein human emotion in its truest form can still be felt by the audience, that I saw its significance and its relevance. This is a very unlikely plot to generate an experience that represents raw emotions, yet nothing short in authenticity.Putting the plot in the context of filmmaking, there are just too many aspects in this film that are very well put together for me to dissect and criticize. Everything was placed in the right place at the right time. The utilization as well as the style of editing, cinematography, sound editing, sound mixing and musical scoring all worked harmoniously in the audio-visual representation of the story.127 Hours is one of those films where one actor will have to carry the whole film to either its success or its demise. Fortunately, actor James Franco has gone a long way in his acting career by making the right decisions or else, he might not have made it to Aron Ralston's place, stuck in that deep gorge. The true-to-life story adapted in Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy's screenplay requires a young character who is extreme and strong-hearted especially during difficult times, yet has his deep relationships with the people around him as both his weakness and his strength. This complicated, yet true of a character, I could not have imagined being portrayed by any other actor.This symphony by Danny Boyle has once again proved himself to be a visionary filmmaker contributing to my world a picture worth consuming.

There is only one real prominent character, for the most part one location, and one major action that takes up nearly the entire movie, so how does this movie remain a riveting experience? A perfect collaboration between actor, director, and writers.Danny Boyle directs the true story of mountain climber Aron Ralston who gets his arm pinned beneath a boulder and ultimately resolves to cut his arm off to survive and find help. Boyle, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Simon Beaufoy, pumps his kinetic visual style throughout the entire movie, using split-screen to marvelous effect to show Ralston's fast-paced, ADD lifestyle. I mean, no one other than Boyle would take shots inside Ralston's arm, or inside Ralston's water bottle. Not only that, Boyle manages to keep this movie from being simply about the situation of being trapped beneath a boulder by including video messages that Aron makes on his digital camera to his friends and family, in case anyone ever finds it, but where the movie really finds its heart and its message is when Aron starts slipping in-and-out of consciousness and blurs his dreams, memories, and reality, all into one.Actor James Franco plays Ralston as a self-absorbed man, who finds pathos in the end realizing he can't do it all on his own. The greatest thing about Franco's performance, is it feels real, it actually looks and sounds as if he is in the same pain that Ralston most likely was in this situation. Franco holds nothing back and it is primarily because of his reaction that makes the scene where he actually cuts through his arm so tense, not to mention the precise editing and building music by A.R. Rahman.If there is one thing that 127 Hours is about is the perseverance of the human soul to continue living, even in the most extreme circumstances, and to find that this near death experience only humbles Ralston and makes him a changed man makes the movie all the more affecting and uplifting.I give 127 Hours a 10 out of 10!

Much like Slumdog Millionaire, Trainspotting and 28 Days Later; 127 Hours is such a fantastic experience, despite the incredibly heavy subject matter. From the beginning to the end 127 Hours had me glued to the screen, leaving me speechless and incredibly emotional. What made this even more powerful was the ever-present theme of the importance of human contact, which was never made to be sentimental, but which was a gentle reminder of the significance of family, friends and partners.Boyle took on a big challenge when he chose to make a film based mostly in a canyon with a man whose arm is trapped under a rock. It was never an easy task, as it is an action movie with no action in the typical sense. However, Boyle uses his creativity, which can be found in many of his previous films, to keep his audience captivated and thoroughly engaged in the proceedings. Showing us views from all different angles (even from inside water bottles and tubings) in order to enhance the horrible situation and make it seem more ""in your face."" For instance, we see inside the tubing of the water backpack a couple of times, which may seem pointless, but when we see it as he is drinking his urine from it it becomes much more visceral and gut-wrenching. During the many flashbacks and hallucinations that Aron Ralston (James Franco) experiences Boyle utilises his hyper-kinetic editing style to show his delusional state of mind, although sometimes it can be slightly overdone.Another reason this movie is so good is a result of James Franco's outstanding performance. A whole range of emotions are re-enacted with such realism and grittiness it is hard not to be blown away. He is just a tour-de-force...his pain seems real, his psychological breakdown scary and his dark humour uncomfortably funny. Franco is rightly being recognised for his job, and if he gets the Oscar I will not be surprised or disappointed.A.R. Rahman once again collaborates with Boyle to produce a stunning soundtrack never seems out of place, perfectly accompanying the dramatic scenes and the horrific amputation scene. Yes, the scene is shocking, brutal, and graphic, but is not the reason to see this movie. It is the events leading up to it, and the reasons behind it which truly make this movie worth seeing. Boyle has managed to turn a tale of survival, courage and hope into a very un-American, uncliched story. It is not an epic tale with a thrilling climax, it is an honest story of one man's will to live once he realises what he has to live for. It may not be totally uplifting, but its message is nonetheless important.127 Hours is not for everyone, but I would recommend it to anyone and everyone I could. It is hard to watch at times, but it is so well made on all fronts (be it directing, writing, acting, or scoring) that it is easily one of the best films of 2010.4_Ã¢/5 ","   Danny Boyle  created  cinematic treasure.

I don't know, but Aron Ralston do, he accepted the fact that that rock stuck on his arm is waiting for him all of his life. We tend to think a lot more when we are stuck with life itself. Aron Ralston had so much to think in what he thought was his last days. He thought of that party he was invited by the last two people he saw, he thought about his memorable and happy days with his family, he blamed himself, for being selfish and for being stuck there, well he can't blame the rock. He had so much time to think that he felt guilty of some of the things he took for granted. Well, that's what we're going to feel when we're helpless and waiting to die on our own mistake. Danny Boyle, after his Slumdog Millionaire won the best picture two years ago, had come back with another brilliant film, but in a different set of standards, for me this is his best so far. This is not boring, considering one location and one actor present on almost the whole duration of the film. That's not only because of Danny Boyle's techniques but also because of James Franco's outstanding acting, he's best performance of his career. He plays the cocky athlete who lived to tell his agonizing experience. It is a torture both to the audience and to Ralston throughout the film. When the fact that he's not going to be saved by anyone became clear to him, he is faced with two choices: Lose your arm or lose your life? He's got the courage to live and he deserved to be alive today. Maybe he was meant to be in that situation for him to start a new life, a more cautious life. In his first attempt of cutting his arm, I was thinking: Don't do that, that's nasty and real painful, there's no way that that tool will gonna cut it, just wait for somebody. But the second time he tried it I really knew he was going to do it, it's sickening and disgusting but there's no other option. I can't imagine myself in that situation, because it's hard to lose any part of our body, especially the arm, especially when you're the one doing it. He had no third choice, time is a factor, he had to let go of his arm rather than letting go of his life. After watching this film, I thought that life is beautiful just to let it go when you've got a choice to keep it. You've got to give credit to James Franco, he played it with the confidence of his character and with a convincing detail. I haven't seen yet the performance of the two actors nominated in this year's Academy Awards, Javier Bardem in Biutiful and Colin Firth in The King's Speech, so right at this moment I have to say that James Franco did better than Jesse Eisenberg and Jeff Bridges, but Colin Firth has the upper hand because he had already won on the Actors Guild and Golden Globe. I have to see The King's Speech as soon as possible, so that I can know who I'm going to support. But talking about courage, Aron Ralston got a heavy dose of it, as he continues to do the thing that makes him happy, mountain climbing. No pain, no gain.

Danny Boyle is a great director, and this is a good film, but there's no getting around the fact that its scope is as limited as the resources in Aron Ralston's backpack.An adaptation of ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place,"" Ralston's true account of having his arm lodged beneath a boulder in an isolated Utah canyon, Boyle's interpretation relies perhaps a little too heavily on the built-in adjectives like 'harrowing' and 'powerful;' he doesn't seem to add many of his own. The film is certainly more successful than this year's ""Buried,"" in which Ryan Reynolds spends the entirety of a film trapped inside a coffin in Iraq, but then Ryan Reynolds is no James Franco.Franco's multifaceted performance really anchors the film and keeps it from becoming stagnant. The journey of his character, from devil-may-care adventurer to anguished prisoner, is kept in constant motion even though he is physically immobile. Franco embraces not only what makes Ralston heroic, but also what makes him human, and we need that accessibility in order to participate in the film's more brutal moments.And Boyle definitely doesn't disappoint in the intensity department. More so than any filmmaker in recent memory, he commands attention with his unflinching depictions of violence here. On the off chance that some aren't yet familiar with the outcome of Ralston's story, I won't spoil it__suffice it to say ""127 Hours"" is not for the squeamish. I consider myself among a generation of roundly desensitized moviegoers, but the way Boyle puts the screws to his audience during key sequences is undeniably affecting. Expect to do a fair amount of squinting and inhaling through gritted teeth.I only wish the film on the whole had the same impact as those isolated scenes. Boyle cobbles together what little conventional narrative he can from the five day ordeal, but it never fully ensnares. Flashbacks seem like a given, though the brief instances of escape we witness via dream or memory aren't especially interesting until they began mingling with Ralston's increasingly distorted reality. Even still, I'd argue Boyle doesn't dig deep enough into Ralston's deteriorating mental state__merely explaining the emotional impetus for his physical actions is about as far as he goes.Part of the problem may be the visual experimentation Boyle implements in the interest of keeping things fresh. It serves that purpose fine__""127 Hours"" is a lively, energetic film in spite of its subject matter. In a way, however, the triptych music video approach feels like Boyle taking the easy way out. After all, the man is a master of genres; a greater feat might have been to capture the quiet desolation and solemnity of Ralston's trip through equally inauspicious filmmaking. It would never have been as exciting a film, but it might have been a better one.Don't get me wrong, ""127 Hours"" is still a terrific accomplishment, and one for which Boyle and Franco deserve joint recognition. It feels like a minor entry into the esteemed director's oeuvre, but the creative decisions he made (fault them though I might) showcase his ever- innovative eye for shooting and editing. The visceral impact of the images he conveys is unquestionably the foremost strength of this film, and it is that aspect that critics have already lauded and audiences will doubtless remember.The effectiveness of such scenes earn ""127 Hours"" an adjective like 'harrowing.' I just can't quite bring myself to call it powerful.

But, this movie met the challenge of turning this 20 minute news-magazine segment into a mostly engaging feature film.

Were you expecting some witty banter or maybe some car chases? Imagine, in today's culture, being without distractions for one hour let alone five days.

I don't care how bad I play, I have never once been in the position to even consider cutting my own arm off to get back to the clubhouse.That being said__ This is an incredibly intense, rough, and powerful film that is by no means easy to watch, but it is quite good.If you don't knew the story, Aron Ralston, an avid outdoors-man, mountaineer, hiker, biker, all of that, goes off for a weekend ride and exploration without telling anyone where he's going and had the worst possible thing happen to him. No, he wasn't killed or sodomized by hill folk, a rock in a cave he was climbing gave way, pinning his arm to the wall of the cave. In the middle of nowhere, out of view, and running low on supplies his case seemed hopeless until he made the realization that ""I have a great tourniquet."" Oh, and it's a true story.This film focuses on the 127 hours from when he falls to the moment he makes a decision that most people couldn't even consider making. What you have here is a person, faced with a dire situation, no food, little water, unable to even turn around, having to jerry rig a climbing harness just to sleep, seeing his life for what it is, the good and the bad. This film presents a man laid bare and shows what you learn about yourself and life when it appears you will lose it.The film itself is extremely well made. Danny Boyle pulls out as many stops as one can when dealing with a scenario that renders the camera immobile for a majority of the proceedings. Visually, he seems to be locked into his ""Slumdog Millionaire"" film grammar. It has that look and feel, the rich colors, the slightly slowed action, rewound scenes, flashbacks to small details we missed the first time, but the thematic elements keep it from feeling like a retread. He mixes a very stylized editing and grandiose establishing shots that show the vastness of the landscape with shaky hand held tracking shots that make you feel personally involved.What I found most impressive was his use of sound. Not only to convey the isolation, but, more impressively, to communicate the intense pain of a self preformed amputation. The use of the camcorder, not only as source for on screen footage but as a second character, is incredibly affecting, and allows James Franco (in the performance of his career) to show the emotional swings from a forced joy to borderline insanity, and finally into the determination to live that would drive a man to such action.This is not an easy film to watch, but it is not the people fainting at screenings histrionic affair that some are making it out to be. What it is is a very honest and real portrayal of what happens when you are confronted with losing everything.Read more from me at www.thefilmthugs.com ","  movie   reason  don't go camping, hiking,  engage   outdoor activity   golf.  don't care  bad  play,   never     position  even consider cutting   arm   get back   clubhouse.That  said__    incredibly intense, rough,  powerful film    no means easy  watch,    quite good.If  don't knew  story, Aron Ralston,  avid outdoors-man, mountaineer, hiker, biker,   , goes    weekend ride  exploration without telling anyone   going    worst possible thing happen  .

Based on the true story, it is 2003, Aron Ralston (Spider-Man's Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated James Franco) was an adventurer, and his favourite hobby was mountain climbing, so he plans his next trip to the isolated Canyonlands National Park of Utah, with its many smooth rock faces, slopes and caverns. He has not told anyone he knows where he is going, and the last two people to be hanging around with Aron in the canyon were Megan McBride (Amber Tamblyn) and Kristi Moore (Kate Mara). Soon after leaving the girls Aron continues climbing, and exploring the Blue John Canyon, when he slips, dislodging a large rock boulder which crushed his right forearm, pinning it to the canyon wall. So begins the 127 hours, i.e. five days and seven hours, of the title, the total amount of time he was trapped without anyone around to rescue him and knowing no-one will be looking for him. With his left arm free Aron tries to find ways to try and release his already helpless arm from the rock, or dislodge the rock, using any strength or tools he has at his disposal. While doing this he occasionally films himself on his digital camera, drinks the very little water he has left, and eating the food he has little of. Aron eventually finishes the water and forces himself to drink his own urine, and as the time gets slower he also has small flashback and flash-forward visions of the girlfriend he left, before leaving for Utah, the girls he met, and what he could have been doing. Beleiving he will soon die he films his goodbyes to his family in case the footage is found, and he carves his birth and supposed death date on the cavern wall. Dehydrated and delirious Aron finally made the dramatic decision to get himself out bu using a rope to tourniquet (stop any bleeding) and his small tool knife to cut through the elbow area and break free. Once he worked his way outside, he made his way down the cliffs and with not much energy he does manage to get the attention of some people nearby, who give him water, and call a helicopter to rescue him. The final end credits, featuring the real Aron Ralston, said that he got married, had a child, and from now on always make sure to let everyone know where he is going. Also starring Cl Ãmence Po Ãsy as Rana, Lizzy Caplan as Sonja Ralston, Treat Williams as Aron's Dad and Kate Burton as Aron's Mom. You could say this is a near one person movie, like Cast Away before, only it is based on reality, with a fantastic performance by Franco in a film that relies on great editing and some moving music, you do have to squeamish gory arm removal, but it doesn't make any difference to the entertainment you will get from this mesmerising true story drama.

127 Hours,776,khsu,18/Nov/10,1,1.1988596191063422e-12,film one not even films time can way life much love just makes little still look never see first made world people many ever something real often human sense american character picture take man get audience self really seen isnt right,0.246575342,73.0,inf,inf,inf," First, let's not talk about the cop-out 'reminiscing/fantasy' sequences that practically intercut every other scene in this man-gets-into-some-deep-subterranean-trouble, now a veritable subgenre in the supposed one-man-body-horror category--come on, if you want to do claustrophobic, then DO claustrophobic (cf Hitchcock, Polanski, Lynch)--because, I suspect, Boyle himself knows there isn't much clothing on the proverbial emperor here: Nothing to film here, folks. And nothing to see.It's certainly not unexpected, albeit still somewhat bemusing, to see several audience members walk out of the theater, scratching their heads while mumbling to each other: 'What was the point of THAT?' Yes, what WAS the point? Let's look at it, shall we? He got what he deserved, right? Either you read that, as he said himself (perhaps as the hallucinations really began setting in), as 'everything in his life has led him to this point,' recognition of self in world, lesson learned via trauma etc, etc...or, maybe even with a tad of Schadenfreude, we can all claim with the Universe that the a##hole was put in his place...Doesn't matter. You'd be wrong.And this where the film manages actually to get somewhat interesting, and mildly subversive. (And props to Dan if this were intended, but I doubt it.) THE REAL FILM, a la Hamlet, in the film is the flashback sequences (whose frequency of occurrence here is no accident). In particular, those ones involving his childhood and adolescence. I love how there was just a nuanced, near-missed undertone of paternal resentment in the sequences involving his father, who sets up his nerdy, weakling son (the glasses/contacts--a Kleinian partial object if there ever was one) to be an inevitable failure, a disappointment (the rock therefore is really just the paternal superego). Maternal absence? Check. (The link to China and the global economy via the pocketknife-gift couldn't have been more perfect and made more explicit here--but more on that in a bit.) The Trauma in the film is not the arm caught in the rock, which is simply one more emanation from the Real Traumatic Core, obliquely referred to in the reminiscing sequences about his *SISTER*. If you watch carefully (the piano-playing scenes, and how later he said he missed her wedding--both first-person, camcorded), there is just a subtle hint of incest between him and the sister, and between the father and the sister. The Real Trauma here is the jealousy between him and his father, and the fact that his father CASTRATED him as a result--which is simply repeated and reenacted here by the explicit 'dismemberment' scene. (By the way, are we supposed to hear the American Online dial-up tone every time we cut into bone? I've never seen so many blatantly serial product placements in one film in my life--but more on 'the global economy' later.) Never confuse message with code. Films often tell us one thing, but show us another. When he finally dismembers himself and breaks free (physically speaking), what's the first thing he does? Take a picture. Ah, the invincibility of human beings on Earth, the superior indomitability of the human spirit (echoing the song in the beginning), literally reified for the masses to watch here--I kid not, the audience literally cheered, at that exact moment. What's all that hullabaloo about understanding one's place in the world? Respect for nature, the universe...? You can forget it now; Americans (and the colonialist Brits) like to WIN. And whom does he run into first in his 'escape?' The prototypical middle-class nuclear family--Mommy (Third World, 'untapped' resources, Earth, material), sonny (petit bourgeois), and Daddy (the State): the Oedipal structure of the flow of capital is re-affirmed once again. (Does the helicopter remind anybody a little too much of the last scene in Lord of the Flies?) It's truly gratifying to be able to re-insert oneself into the order of consumption-meaning-social network, isn't it? (The truth is, our protagonist has never left it.) Where everything makes sense again--and the audience cheered.On the surface, the films says: Global Capitalism Bad. In reality, everything it shows demonstrates its unconscious flipside--its absolute and unwavering, total support of it (the split-screen diptych at the end of the cave paintings and the global consuming 'masses' today, couldn't show this more clearly), that it's nothing if not the natural order of things. God=Capital. C'est la vie.Another film of late about a man being trapped underground is similar: What it says--Terrorism Bad. What it shows--terrorists are people too (the main character actually says something to this effect), and the American bureaucracy (shown to be maddeningly ineffective, indifferent, and eerily Kafkaesque) actually DESERVES terrorism??? In this sense, this particular film is in fact quite radical (while appearing conservative in nature), whereas 127 Hours is extremely conservative (while being liberal in appearance).Films like these, so empty and devoid of any content, really act as the perfect vessel for a bunch of calcified, subterranean ideologies.Watch them.

Another thing that really bothered me was that so much was almost going wrong the whole time. Every second of the film had a 'close call' which made the film seem totally unrealistic. Examples are planes taking off just before the runway collapses or driving just fast enough to not get hit by an explosion. This can be very cool if it doesn't happen 100% of the time and I have never seen a movie abusing this way of creating excitement to this extent.

A technique that works perfectly for classic Bruce Willis or Arnie films giving you 2 hours of entertainment and fun. Unfortunately this time it did not work. ""2012"" delivers so many low blows to a homo sapiens' mind that some kind of subconscious alarm must have been triggered that woke up my brain to avoid any permanent damage. Then the real suffering began.You don't expect to get a good script with witty dialog and good storytelling in movies like this - and you don't get it. You don't expect the best and most convincing actors in the world in movies like this - and you don't get them. Woody Harrelson being the only exception. You probably don't expect the best editing, lighting, costume designing etc. in movies like this - and you don't get them.You DO expect overwhelming visuals in this kind of movies - you get them partially. You DO expect thrills and suspense and surprises in this kind of movies - you don't get them.Roland Emmerich artfully manages to make watching the end of the world in monumental pictures a thoroughly boring experience. Why? Because this film never touches you in any way. The main characters remain shallow throughout the whole 158 minutes. Some are just not interesting, others are so overdrawn (Yuri, Tamara) that you just can't think of them as real people. The story does not develop and lead to something you did not expect. There is no flow. Ridiculous action scenes alternate with pathetic, kitschy good-bye talks that fail to catch you because NO actual human being would ever talk or act in the ways depicted here. There is no realism at all in virtually any scene of the film so how could you manage to connect to it?But the worst of all is the awkward exaggeration in EVERYTHING shown on the screen. It is nice to see a nail-biting last-second escape in a movie. Seeing your main characters taking a one-in-a-million chance every ten minutes is revolting. It is an insult to your intelligence. In this respect ""2012"" has set a new standard. It makes all four ""Indiana Jones"" movies look like documentaries. Who cares for the laws of physics? Just invent new ones if it is necessary to save the hero!Of course this is fiction and you are allowed some creativity to keep things going but there is a limit to what you can ask from the viewer to believe.*** Spoiler*** My ""favourite"" scene of the movie: Our heroes are on a Russian cargo plane heading for China. The plane is piloted by one professional and a student pilot who has had a few hours on a single engine sports airplane(?). After having survived a last-second escape (see?) from the airport they are planning to get a refueling at Hawaii. Unfortunately the island has turned into a lump of molten lava and they have to continue their flight knowing they would not make it to China but go down somewhere in the open waters. The very moment they run out of fuel they discover that the Asian continent has moved 2500 kilometers in their direction(!) and they crash-land their aircraft on some elevated plain a stone's throw from the original destination! Of course there is a group of helicopters flying by only minutes later to pick them up and get them to the secret base they were heading for... *** End of Spoiler ***And no, this is not an exception. There are numerous parts like this. It is just like I said: an insult to your intelligence.Believe me, I could easily list at least a hundred of flaws and errors made in this movie ranging from human behavior over technical design to mathematical chances - not even regarding the constant violation of physical principles.All in all I am convinced that it is for your own good not to spend your money on buying a ticket for this crap but find any other use for it.

The whole movie is almost entirely comprised of special effects. Of course you'll see all of the lead characters survive scenarios that a regular human being would not. Some of the scenes are so ridiculously unbelievable that you want to laugh at the fodder that's being expected of you to believe. Emmerich certainly pushes ""suspension of disbelief"" to its limit.John Cusack and Woody Harrelson are the only actors that attempt to hold the film together, while Danny Glover and Thandie Newton were an utter and complete let-down considering their previous work history. You won't see any remotely Oscar-worthy performances here. The casting of this film seemed off and poorly executed. You could tell the bulk of the financial budget went to the special effects and not the actors.The thing that I found thoroughly disappointing about 2012 is that it's almost entirely lacking of any interesting backstory or intellectual substance whatsoever. There's very little mention of the Mayan calendar, Mayan history, or any of the prophetic wisdom that has foreseen the supposed end of days. The fear, analysis, curiosity, and everything else you've ever wondered about this new mysterious year that is quickly approaching is almost entirely removed from this film. That would have and could have made this film closer to a 10 if I didn't feel like my brain was utterly wasted on this CGI and special effects bonanza. They try to cram so many explosions, eruptions, earthquakes, and natural disasters into two hours that I might be a little desensitized to the real thing if it ever happens. After awhile nothing felt realistic or interesting about it at all.It's novelty entertainment at best and that's it. You won't wince at how painfully awful this movie is, and you won't walk away knowing anything meaningful about 2012, but hopefully you'll help repay Sony pictures for the exorbitant amount of money that they and Roland Emmerich spent on their special effects budget.

At roughly 2 million dollars a minute, one might at least expect a thrill-a-second work of exciting entertainment, since one does not go to a Roland Emmerich movie expecting either art or deep meaning. Unfortunately, the many millions spent on this bloated, overblown ""B"" genre programmer could not guarantee the filmmakers a good script with a tight plot and interesting characters. Emmerich treats his own screenplay (co-written by Harold Klausner) with a level of seriousness customarily reserved for the Holocaust or biopics of figures like Jesus Christ or Mahatma Ghandi. There is no plot to speak of - Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) learns of the impending end of the world and has to rescue his offspring and ex-wife from danger. That's all that happens in the entire movie - for over 2.5 hours! By the 4th or 5th time we have seen Jackson and his gang escape death (whether by earthquake, plane crash, volcanic eruption, tsunami, etc., etc.) the whole thing has become so turgid and wearisome that one finds oneself rooting for the tsunami to kill them all just so the movie can end and one can go home. The thin plot might not be all that bad if the film were better-paced and more exciting, but Emmerich wants you to know that he is A Serious Auteur and that 2012 is an Important Film About Our Time, so every sequence keeps going WAY past its sell-by date. Watching this movie is like being hit in the head with a wooden plank multiple times - one is eventually stunned into abject submission. Emmerich does everything at least twice, and his respect for his own material seems to have convinced him that 2012 could not have been shorter by one second, when at least 45 minutes of useless sub-plots involving disposable minor characters as well as repetitive sequences of cities collapsing, flames covering the sky, 1500 meter waves drowning everything in sight and famous monuments crumbling into depthless chasms could and should have been left on the cutting-room floor. By the time Jackson saves the high-tech ark containing what's left of North American civilization (don't ask), apparently by channeling Shelley Winters' swim scene from The Poseidon Adventure, any sense of awe which the sight of huge waves washing over the Himalayas should generate in the audience has been replaced by a numb wish that the whole thing will be over soon and a prayer that one's brain death will only be temporary. After watching a whole lot of cities get destroyed again and again, one simply becomes mentally and visually exhausted by the whole bloated mess. Surprisingly strong performances from a thoroughly professional cast are wasted on tissue-thin characterizations - but believe me, these performers earned their money just from being able to say the bland, clich Ãd lines they are given with a straight face. Furthermore, despite the appearance of realism thanks to some technically flawless CGI, there is no blood or gore - there should be body parts raining down from the sky during the destruction of LA, but somehow no one seems to be on the streets. On the other hand, a lot of blood and gore might have reminded the movie audience that one is in fact watching a film about the extinction of literally billions of living things, but why should something so petty be more important than seeing whether John Cusack will get back together with his ex-wife and become a hero so his whiny, spoiled son will accept him? In any case, what does it say about contemporary society that a movie showing nothing less than the destruction of the entire world is rated ""PG-13""? As far as the ""science"" and ""facts"" behind this utterly ridiculous bit of piffle, the less said about that, the better. Of course, this piece of overblown trash will probably turn hundreds of millions for its makers and secure Emmerich's position as one of the top commercial directors of the day. At least if the world actually ends in 2012, all copies of 2012 will be destroyed.

2012,781,Dan Franzen (dfranzen70),03/Dec/09,2,1.3168854829296863e-14,film movie one not good will well funny even films time best can characters make just makes movies little enough look fun two only see made also world people big often sense feel kind take get really screen works seen long hollywood isnt right might plot,0.66958042,572.0,inf,inf,inf," There is now a long, grand history of disaster films in Hollywood. The best of the lot have combined suspense with cutting-edge effects to keep your adrenaline pumping. The worst combine cheesy CGI with shallow characters whose deaths won't affect you much.Here's 2012, summed up: Look, some recognizable landmark! Kablam! Look, a giant wave! Wooo! Do our intrepid Good Guys have enough time to outrun the imploding planet and foil a plot to save only the pretty, rich people? Probably! It's pretty clear what happened to bring us to this point. Roland Emmerich, who's made such cinematic classics as Independence Day, The Patriot, Godzilla, and The Day after Tomorrow, was asked if he wanted a quintillion billion bazillion dollars to make a movie about the end of the world, and he said sure. Then he took parts of each movie's script, filmed them mostly with CGI, and pocketed the rest. Viola! Greatest movie! (A quick break to sum up the plot. Apparently, the sun and the planets have all aligned with the center of the galaxy, which winds up causing the Earth's crust to break up, which then causes the tectonic plates to shift. Mass hysteria! Dogs and cats, living together! The End.) See, there are two ways Emmerich could have gone with this movie. He could have given us characters to follow whom we cared a little about, thus involving us in their plights, and mixed in some convincing special effects. Or he could have said, ""The heck with the characters, give me blowy-uppy thingys."" This sometimes works: See Independence Day, a movie that made me feel pretty good when I left the theater after seeing it but that ultimately, frankly, was pretty bad.Emmerich chose the latter. Which would have been fine, but the effects themselves are wildly unrealistic and often take so long to set up that you completely notice how godawful they really are. For example __ and if you've seen the trailer, this is in there __ there's a scene in which the Sistine Chapel falls, crushing thousands of spectators. Because the toppling is so slow to complete, it becomes painfully obvious that it's just a film running on a screen behind people running away. Sad and unintentionally hilarious.And you can forget about the plot, really, because most of it makes no sense anyway and would happen only in a Big Movie like this. Of COURSE John Cusack is divorced from his hot, bitchy wife (Amanda Peet) and of COURSE she's hooking up with a plastic surgeon who of COURSE winds up having had some flying lessons that of COURSE will save them all and of COURSE Cusack's young son will somehow save the day as well and of COURSE there is a Russian businessman who used to be a boxing legend and of COURSE he punches someone out. And of COURSE people say ""My God!"" a lot, because that's what people do in crappy disaster films. And of COURSE the president is black, because in Hollywood black people get to be president only if disaster is a-coming.At least the acting isn't horrible. Because everyone just runs from place to place in an effort to escape the horror, there aren't any subtle, low-key scenes that would allow good actors to flourish. Cusack is good in general, but what the heck is he doing in here? He's usually so good at picking projects, and he chose this? Willingly? Oliver Platt plays the kind of role that Bruce McGill typically gets, the hamhanded, I'm-in-charge, Al-Haig-like politician. I can't even remember his title. Danny Glover gets to be president and does get the best dialog in the film, even if his role isn't a big one. Woody Harrelson, as a crazed DJ deep in Yellowstone is also a lot of fun, although he's not the kind of guy you'd want to sit next to on a transatlantic flight.Final verdict: Yikes. Yikes, yikes, and yikes. If you dare watch this travesty, you might find yourself laughing hysterically at things __ and this is important __ that were not meant to be funny. If that's your thing, this is your movie. I managed to see this as a matin Ãe, so I'm not out the $10-$15 that some people are right now, so at least I got that going for me. Best advice: Watch it for free at home on a big-screen TV to fully appreciate the magnitude of suck.

But, that is not why we go to movies anyway, is it? That is like going to see Godzilla expecting to learn something about giant lizards that vomit radioactive spray. Emmerich has taken a fictitious subject he knew would be controversial and woven some drama into it. People who tend to be slightly paranoid will no doubt be even more so after seeing the world destroyed according to interpretations of prophecy. The people who sell the books promoting the fear make money, just like the movie producers. So what? I didn't see this movie to pick up any information I haven't learned from the History Channel, nor do I believe any more than I did before, that anything bad is going to happen on December 21, 2012. Did I go expecting to be highly entertained by great CGI and action? Yes! And I wasn't disappointed! One thing many reviewers haven't been picking up on while watching this movie is the very slight tongue-in-cheekiness of the subject that Emmerich cleverly wove into the plot. He obviously doesn't believe any of the prophecy any more than most of the rest of us do. You can see it in the actors' performances too: Woody Harrelson, to wit. It is the same as a weatherman who can deliver his forecast each night without laughing because he truly doesn't know with certainty what is going to happen, but he tries to make us believe nonetheless.See this movie if you love cinema. Enjoy the things about cinema that make it great. Take a small pillow for your butt cheeks because almost 3 hours of sitting in an uncomfortable theater seat will make you wish you had. But fear not. There is so much non-stop action you won't notice the discomfort too much.The film has obvious flaws, trite clich Ãs, and phony science, but if you are a fan of 50's sci-fi, you will love this movie. And remember, don't take it too seriously folks, just enjoy it. The end of the world isn't going to happen in 2012, there really aren't any giant grasshoppers, ants, or lizards roaming the Earth, and no one's career is going to end because of their role in this movie. It is Hollywood having a good time with a controversial subject. Nothing new there.Enjoy the show!

I've seen lots of films that were crapper, but this one was so damn aggravating. And unfortunately I went to see it by myself, so I couldn't relieve the tension by turning to a friend to say 'I HATE this film and want these characters TO DIE'.To start with the okay things first - some of the disaster sequences were hugely excessive and brilliantly creative in their way (9 or 10 out of 10), it's ambitious in size, and the cast was mostly good. I enjoyed the comic Russians, even though they were clich Ãd. I've enjoyed slightly silly disaster films in the past, like Knowing and The Day After Tomorrow, so I try not to take a snob attitude towards them.Now for some of why I HATED this - *SPOILERS* * Other people have commented on the 'heroes' (ie the dysfunctional white family) escaping every disaster at the last moment, more unbelievably than Indiana Jones ever did. While everyone else screams & falls down, continents literally move across the globe for this family's convenience! This is amusing once or twice, but then just gets silly. The emotional problem with this is that you can then only take this as being enjoyable action-comedy. But at the same time BILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE BEING KILLED (there's no gore, but it's clear everyone on the planet is violently killed), and then even more amazingly you are meant to care whether this dull dysfunctional family gets back together. No, I wanted them DEAD! * This family is AWFUL. Despite the world going to hell, they care for nobody but themselves. They even take their escapes for granted, and all they can give the dying people around them are blank stares and then go back to talking about their personal issues. At least their young girl has the decency to sob once or twice (okay, I take back wanting her dead, but not the others). At a point later in the film, where the mother begs someone to save her kids, I wanted them to ask her what she'd ever done for anyone else's? What a cow. Drown em. * There's nothing wrong with depicting world disaster through the eyes of an ordinary family, but the story isn't actually told through their eyes only, so their importance is never explained. Why am I meant to care? * Did every African-American have to be so bloody noble? EVERY SINGLE ONE? * Having all the non-Americans get the secondary roles left a nasty taste. Because the rule in disaster films is that most of those secondary characters are just there to be killed off. The WORLD is ending, not just the US. But everyone takes orders from the US President, everyone is happy to talk English, and if you're a character from outside the US in this movie, say your prayers. Or rather, don't even bother. * What was the point of filling ships with billionaires? Their money would help build the things, but once everyone else on the planet dies, crusty old billionaires are not only not the best people to hang around with (they're generally not known for their manual labour or scientific skills), but after the world is destroyed so will 99% of their wealth! Their assets will be wiped out. There is no bloody point! A possible plot-line would have involved SOME billionaires bribing their way on board. But boatfuls of them? I have a low opinion of billionaires, but am certain most would be way too smart to think that was a good idea. * This film is kind of insulting to other nations. Even though plenty of US Presidents have been creeps, not all of them have been, and I can accept a heroic US President in a film. BUT, it's insulting to have other world leaders follow him blindly, and have him behave so nobly, going down with his country, while then portraying the Queen of England as one of the loathsome billionaires buying her way out - considering that the Queen Mum made a point of staying in London during the blitz, it's an insult. There's another uncomfortable point where a character expresses exasperation at the type of people they're saving - just as the camera catches sight of a smug middle-eastern billionaire. It comes across as an insult, whether intentional or not, but this film doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt. Oh, and killing everyone in the Vatican, weird. This kind of mild nastiness could have been fun if the whole film had've been more wicked and bitter, maybe making John Cusack a lovable sleazeball, but no, it has to attempt to pull on our heart-strings too. We are simply meant to love the dull white American family, and want to see them get back together, because Hollywood films take that for granted, and to accept that all African-Americans are amazingly noble, because that's Hollywood being PC.Where I walked out - started to get the urge when the mother begged the Chinese guard to save her children. Would have loved the Chinese guard (oh look, he speaks English) to explain to her why her family didn't deserve his help in the slightest. Where I did walk out - when one of the noble African-Americans made a god-awful speech about why they should try to save more of those horrid billionaires, that those people deserved a chance to live etc. No, I was not going to let these characters try to regain my sympathy so easily after hours of callous behaviour. And I just knew it would be a matter of minutes before John Cusack's character would attempt something similar, through some heroic action (and the plot synopsis on Wikipedia tells me I was right!).

Well, not quite. The humanity was distributed racially according to current Hollywood standards of what are the superior and inferior races.The whites, are generally rather silly or in some cases, outright evil. The chief bad guy is a white adviser to the an idealized President Obama played by Danny Glover who played Danny Glover perfectly. The chief good guys are the president's daughter and black adviser - the latter who is the only character who seems to have some roots in being a human. The others do not.Instead, they are as stereotyped as any 1930's movie, but with different characteristics more or less. The theme is a rush to board savior ships due to the end of the world about to occur. The occupants of the ships will be few compared to the billions about to die. These lucky few come from two pools - the world 'leaders' and their cronies as well as a few who can buy tickets costing roughly $1,500,000,000 each. Some of the wealthy who've bought their tickets are Arabs. Upon noting this, the *good guy*, the black guy, sneers out something like, ""Is this the type of gene pool we wish to preserve?"" saying more about the culture of Hollywood than Arab culture.At one point, a character makes the important point that the savior ships should contain primarily young people who are robust enough to be pioneers and also have the ability to reproduce. Then, a bit later, we see the ancient Queen of England entering the ark ship with her dogs. So much for rational allocation of ark space. In fact, these aren't the only dogs to make it aboard. The film emphasizes in many places how more important it is to save Paris Hilton's dog than any of the humans who are being drowned, ground to a smear, blown up, crushed by avalanches or incinerated. It gleefully shows worshipers gathered at the Vatican to listen to the pope dying as the Vatican crumbles crushing not only them but the pope, the College of Cardinals and others detested by today's Hollywoood. Yet Paris Hilton's dog, getting a good deal of screen time, survives.The Chinese are uniformly cruel inhuman automatons. The Tibetans are uniformly Highly Evolved Spiritual Beings. The whites are, as I said earlier, either idiots behaving like no human would possibly behave or pure evil who surely deserve to die along with the Roman Catholics, the Arabs, and the billions of others who aren't worthy.To give one of many examples of how idiotic and unrealistic the white humans are here, the main character finds his ex wife now seriously involved with a new guy. During the course of their escapades, the new guy dies horribly. The ex wife, not being a Highly Evolved Tibetan or soulful black, pays no mind to her lover's death but instead just flips back, without a second's hesitation, to mating up with the main character.This movie is pure propaganda and as all propaganda, it tells you more about the issuer of the propaganda than the ones targeted.

The real stars of the film are the truly spectacular special effects. Emmerich really pulls out all the stops and creates some truly awesome set-pieces of destruction. In order to ensure that the main characters have endless perilous situations to escape from, we get to see a bunch of natural and man-made wonders get totaled by Mama Nature. Highlights include Los Angeles falling into the sea, Las Vegas being swallowed by the desert, and the Himalayas being submerged by tidal waves.Improbable? Definitely. Ridiculous? You bet.

Obviously the director, producer, and everyone involved in making the movie didn't know that. This is what too many of those directors out there think a movie is. They are all wrong. May I also say that I'm disappointed in the people who wrote good reviews for this movie. Let me explain. First of all, the acting was terrible. I loved Liam James (mostly because he is in Psych, the best TV show ever) and the little girl was adorable and the crazy guy who had that radio station in Yellowstone National Park was fun to watch, but other then those three, all the other characters were just plain boring to watch. Also note that I don't even remember half the characters' names. Anyway, the actors' facial expressions weren't very convincing, and the way they delivered their lines was robotic. Another thing, the characters were not memorable, and it was hard to connect with them. I didn't care about the characters who died at all, because I felt no connection with them at all. Second of all, the situations the characters were in were absolutely ridiculous! One minor character in the beginning calls another character, talks to them about something that has nothing to do with the plot that I could tell, and his car randomly blows up. It had nothing to do with the story, and was completely unnecessary to see. At another point, one major character is stuck in a bus looking for a map (of something that wasn't explained very well) and the back of the bus is on fire because a meteor hit the back. A crevice opens up on the ground and the bus falls into it backwards. The family all think he's dead, until he climbs back out of the crevice with barely a scratch on him. Totally ridiculous. In another scene, the family is driving their car crazily through the streets that started undulating and heaving upward. Thousands of crevices open up, and buildings are falling everywhere. The car crashes into stuff, and even flies over a huge crack on the ground. After this chase, the car is crushed and the doors fall off, but the people inside are unhurt, not even shaken at least. Good Grief. Third of all, for a movie with explosions and disaster scenes, it sure had slow, dull moments. There was too much of ""Should we run toward or away from the danger?"" and ""Should we rescue the important people only, or everybody?"" I wanted to yell at the screen, ""JUST RUN, ALREADY!!!"" Also, they focused too much on the main family in the movie. I sat through too many scenes where they are just doing normal, boring stuff, like talking about the whole divorce thing that must have been going on (but it wasn't important at all to the plot). Last of all, this movie, like too many movies these days, is a showcase of all the fancy, realistic (well, not really) wonders that can be produced by modern computer technology. The only reason I sat through the movie was so I could see buildings crumble and collapse, volcanoes explode, and huge tsunamis crash onto millions of screaming people. I didn't care for any of the characters, as I've said before. When characters died, I felt no sympathy. I didn't even think, ""that's too bad"". I just said to myself, ""Okay, is this thing over yet?"" Two good things about 2012: The action scenes were mildly thrilling (note: I only said MILDLY thrilling) and it didn't end like Knowing did (with ALIENS). Don't bother spending twelve bucks on this disaster of a movie (Hahahaha). You're better off staying FAR AWAY from it. ","  said  ,   say  , SPECIAL EFFECTS  NOT MAKE  GOOD MOVIE.

Crazy government conspiracy cook. Danny Glover? Selfless president. Chiwetel Ejiofor? Intelligent scientist with all the answers. Roland, next time, just blow stuff up. Save the money you'd be paying actors and just blow more stuff up.The effects were all that you would even care to look at here. There was nothing redeeming about this utter pile. The action is so over-the-top and excessive that you can't even tell what's going on half the time. That, and how many times do we have to see the SAME ACTION SEQUENCE? How many times did a plane fall off a crumbling runway in this movie? How many times did John Cusack (aka the world's BEST FRIGGIN' DRIVER EVER) jump over cracks or fireballs or chasms in his vehicle? Seriously, John Cusack is not Superman. Although he can apparently outrun the pyroclastic flow of a FRIGGIN' SUPERVOLCANO. I'm not kidding. Roland Emmerich just took science and not only wiped his rear end with it, he dropped a deuce on its chest and hit it repeatedly in the face with a shovel.But the most ridiculous part of this movie is the film's ""theme"" and how it plays out. Cusack's character is a writer who wrote this book about how human beings need to be selfless and think of others and save each other. Actually a really decent theme, right? Especially with the whole world-is-ending thing.Well now let's apply that theme to the movie at large. It's like 2010 and the government figures out that the world is SCREWED, so they get together with the rest of the world's governments and they get their stuff together and they're gonna save humanity. They are coming up with a plan, damn it, and screw you 2012 apocalypse, MANKIND WILL LIVE ON. Hmmmmm... that's pretty sweet actually. Can't complain about that at all. Mankind will be saved. ASSUMING THAT THEY HAVE A BILLION DOLLARS! That's right. Mankind has to be selfless and love one another, ASSUMING YOU'RE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO HUMANITY or that you HAVE A BILLION DOLLARS *PER SEAT* to buy a ticket on an ark. If you're just Joe-nobody or Jane-nobody, you can basically go get screwed, because the government has no interest in saving you because you're worthless.But they'll at least tell us that doom is impending, right? They'll let us know. I mean they gotta, THE WORLD IS ACTUALLY GOING TO END AND MOST OF HUMANITY WILL DIE. Either that or they'll completely ignore telling us and say nothing for years, and only finally tell us after the Yellowstone SUPERVOLCANO erupts and we're all screwed anyway. I dunno, I just like to think that if the world was going to end, they'd kinda let us simple folk know. In the movie they even said that they ""didn't want to cause anarchy."" WHO CARES?! The WORLD IS GOING TO END. WHO CARES if there's anarchy? You already don't care enough to let us know that we're gonna die, or to include us in your grand ""save humanity"" plan because we're not important enough to you - so who gives a crap if we tear the world apart before mother nature rips the entire Earth a new one? I'll tell you who - really rich and important people, THAT'S WHO! Numerous people are murdered simply because they dare to try to tell people that the Earth is going to flush them down the planetary toilet, and that the world's governments knew AND lied about it, and have a big ""save humanity"" plan that they casually forgot to mention to most of the 6 billion of us living on the planet.I'd like to think that if the world's governments got together in 2010 and said, hey, in 2012, the world is really gonna die, we've got proof, but we've got a plan to build ships and save humanity. We'll need a lot of resources to complete this, do you care? I think a tax hike to pay for a few dozen or so of these big arks to save mankind is a pretty decent reason to take some of my hard-earned money. Granted, they would have to let it be known that not *EVERYONE* could be saved, but hell, at least take the children? Let a new generation have a chance at survival? Nope. Apparently the only way they could afford to pay for the arks is to have really rich people do it, so that really rich people were the only ones who would get saved. I'm sorry, WHAT? It's great to know that honestly, in Emmerich's world, Paris Hilton could be saved from utter destruction of humanity while so many people with at least some kind of intelligence will be left to die in an unholy torrent of hell and fire and DEATH. To top it off, the movie has the arrogance to play its theme at the end when they try to leave a bunch of these way-more-important-than-you people behind, and we get a big impassioned speech about how we have to be selfless and help our fellow man. You know, like the 5 or 6 billion of us you just let die because you were too busy being elitist pricks to tell us the world was going to end or to ask us if we wanted to pitch in some cash to build some live-saving arks.Avoid, avoid, AVOID this movie unless you want to be insulted and told that you'll never be as good or important as the rich and powerful elite.

 end all disaster movies. We sneered a bit, but we believed. Emmerich 
 has been vying to be Hollywood's Demolition King since his 
 ""Independence Day"" (1996), ""Godzilla"" (1998) and ""The Day After 
 Tomorrow"" (2004). Now, with the aid of superior CGI, he seems to have 
 done it.
 
 Basically, ""2012"" is about the Earth melting at the core! The ancient 
 Mayans knew about this and researchers say they have even pinpointed 
 the date to 12-21-12 - or December 21, 2012! Scientifically, though, 
 mutant neutrinos have boiled the Earth's core like a microwave, causing 
 quakes, spilling lava and shifting the Earth's crust. That's right. 
 This means our land mass moves about so violently that we may find 
 Wisconsin right on the South Pole! 
 
 A few people are privy to this info about the imminent end of the 
 world. One person who stumbles onto the truth is writer Jackson Curtis 
 (John Cusack) and he goes all out to get his ex-wife (Amanda Peet) and 
 kids (Liam James and Morgan Lily) to safety. The authorities 
 (represented by Danny Glover as the US President, Oliver Platt as the 
 Chief of Staff and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Adrian Helmsley, the American 
 scientist who alerts the White House) must use the time they have to 
 prepare for Doomsday - and a Brave New World! 
 
 What can I say about a disaster movie that has all the best bits of all 
 the other disaster hits like ""Earthquake"", ""The Poseidon Adventure"", 
 ""Airport"" and ""Armegeddon""? The CGI effects look so real and involving 
 that they keep us on the edge of our seats. Those, plus the Indy 
 Jones-type escapades of Cusack's Jackson who always manages to be just 
 inches and split-seconds away from danger and mayhem. Some of these, 
 like the underwater bid to undo a mechanical problem (a'la Poseidon 
 films), may be old stuff but they mainly keep us occupied for the 
 two-and-a-half hour roller-coaster ride! 
 
 The subplot about Jackson's family set-up is engaging enough but many 
 of the plot turns and situations are utterly preposterous. However, 
 Emmerich makes it clear that he knows how silly they are - by showing 
 some of them in a tongue-in-cheek manner. It is all a theme park 
 extravaganza - a thrill ride through one spectacle after another. I can 
 imagine the fun Emmerich must be having, demolishing national icons 
 like the White House (for a second time), the Christ statue of Rio and 
 even St Peter's of Vatican City.

Family finding a way out through some insane guy looks absurd, the airplane scenes are like ""director forced to create something"". But in general I would say 6/10 for the first half. Second half is the real disaster part. Scenario becomes obviously absurd. Side characters die without reason. Movie kills the bad guy for just being rich. Family reunion, stupid ship problems (how can not the motors run when the doors are open, that was way over stupid). While the water reach thousands of meters, Africa came out untouched because it raises few hundred meters. A specially the last 30 minutes are incredibly boring. Director forgets about the main plot (END OF THE WORLD) and focuses on the escape story of the main character and his family from a jammed door. That adds the cream and here is my vote: 6+1 / 2 =3.5 (I cut 0.5 because of the boys name ""Noah"" which is lame)3/10 at best. Don't believe anyone who votes more than 5.Thank you.

Of course the good characters prevail, and the bad ones die. Of course the good character saves all, saves mankind, and anyone will listen to him.

He can escape from a van which, while he is inside, falls into a lava crevasse. * bad reach Russian guy dies in the end very stupid, while the good poor guys escape. All of them.

Do they get paid per minute of unrealistic, ridiculous and overblown special effects while completely ignoring science? The claims that mutated neutrinos could be causing the core of the earth to melt is a complete joke. In order to cause the earths core, a massive ball of iron, to melt would have required so much energy that life would have been extinguished long before the core would melt, especially in the 3 year timeline given in the film.This movie had some of the stupidest effects I have seen in a long, long time. The limo scene was beyond dumb, especially the gigantic wave following behind. As those sorts of waves travel at around 3000 metres per second or 10,800 Km per hour (around 6000 miles per hour) then I think they would have had a hard time escaping.The speed at which the buildings and the bridge they drove under collapsed was ludicrously slow.The bit with the loaded Antonov An-225 climbing like an empty airliner at an air show was laughable.A tsunami would not have produced a surface wave of the size shown in the middle of the ocean. Tsunami's travel along the bottom, only showing once the tsunami hit the continental shelves.The scene where tropical animals were being transported over a glacier, through frigid high mountain air while slung under helicopters showed that the director had not given even the slightest thought to what would happen to those animals being transported that way.Another laughable scene was the bit when whole flooded hydraulic chamber scene. Considering how high they were and the fact the waves had traveled through the high mountains, the water would have been frigid. Those people trapped in it would have died from hypothermia very quickly.The captain was not being able to start the turbines till the door is closed? Why not? And when the turbines finally started a big cloud of smoke, suggesting that the turbines were burning diesel or some other liquid fuel. Yet we are expected to believe that this fuel would last for a minimum of two months.I was almost falling of my seat laughing during the Everest collision. A multi-thousand ton behemoth like that vessel hitting Mount Everest would have caused a massive ice slide. Yet all that happened was a couple of ice blocks fell and broke a window. And later we see the front of the vessel and there is absolutely no sign that it had run into the side of a mountain.What can I say about the dialog other than how many 7 year old kids did they get to write it. The dialog was lame. The screenplay was a joke, with the good guys getting out of yet another inescapable situation at the last millisecond in the most improbable ways.Yes, the special effects were spectacular and yet it was quite clear they were there to cover up for an incredibly lame, dull and boring screenplay.I am glad I did not pay to see this joke in the cinema.

It's like this: Me and my wife wanted to get a present for her parents' anniversary, so we went to the mall. We decided on the movie first, 'cause we had got there too late, it was starting in half an hour. We said, we'll get the present afterwards... Get this: the room was almost booked, but half of them were reservations, so we thought we'll wait to see if they'll come in time, to pick up their tickets. Some of them didn't, so we were as happy as kids because we knew we were going to sit in the back, where the best viewing conditions are. So... The review... Well... The next morning I told my friends 'Don't event dare to ask!'. I think I would've been the only damn person on this planet, that would've swear at the movie, hadn't been for my wife!!! At about half-time I said to her 'You know, we could go right now, and buy that present... I can't take this anymore!' And she really took her time, and evaluated what I said. There were some idiots on our left who were continuously laughing at the movie, who suddenly didn't seem the eternal idiotic spectators anymore, that always laugh when there's no reason to! Even I was almost laughing at almost each damn scene! I'm so sorry I payed for it! But I tell you, it's a scam! The picture will take the trip around the world, and will make so much money on behalf of us, the idiots! ... And we thought that action movies will be the only movies we were going to watch in a theater, from now on... Well... I guess, not even that genre is worth it anymore. I mean, come on!!! The only good actor was that damn dog of Natasha, or whatever her name was! And, yes! The final part, where the arks come in. The entire view of the huge caves in the mountain, where they were being built, that was fabulous! And people's will to do anything, in order to save themselves. It was epic! But that's it! Just for the info, I happen to like aircraft, and know just about anything concerning them. And I know that the Antonov 225 is the largest aircraft flying at this moment on Earth, but I can tell you that AN 225 seemed to be able to do aerobatics that only small Cessnas are!!! If one loses control of the AN 225, it would take some 6-7 kms height, before he could rise its nose again, not some 400 metres, as it looked quite clearly in the images where the earth was tearing apart, and the plane had somehow entered beneath its surface level. Let's be serious, man! There's no way, such a huge wave could ever cross India, and reach the Himalayas! There's no way, such a huge wave could ever form itself!!! Yes, it takes an earthquake, thus a continuous movement, for a tsunami to form. But for a 5 mile high tsunami... It would need some 10s of thousands of kms before it could reach that height. And the distance between the center of the Indian Ocean and Mt. Everest is about, I think, 4-5000 kms. It's outrageous! I'm only hoping some actors within this movie won't commit suicide... Come to think of it, as somebody wrote here, Hollywood has downgraded, and I don't know what to expect of the new Dune adaptation that's about to come... It's my favourite book!

HOW WRONG WAS I! I drove down the coast to Miramar Cinemas, Malaga, Spain in anticipation. 3 of us had bought our tickets on-line to see the ""V.O"" version, (""Version Original"") so, no subtitles in Spanish, just the film as it came from the distributor. There are versions called ""V.O.S"" (Version Original Subtitulado) - Subtitled in Spanish. As there are many English speaking people living in these parts, the theatre was quite full, all ages settled down and then the experience began. The opening scene includes an opening caption which is in the original film, placing us at present day, HOWEVER, the film had Spanish subtitles under that caption - IRRITATING, which will be very obvious later. My friend sat next to me asked what it was about, and I told him the film was based on prophecies and the Mayan Calendar, and we settled back to watch. My first issue, as is with most of these films, is why STILL after all that happened on September 11th, do American Studios STILL put the main film build up or explanations of things from a very biased US stand point. After 911 I would have thought the US would have ""got it"" as to why they were attacked - FOR ARROGANCE, yet here we get a portrayal of a 2009 where the US ONCE again is the policeman of the world, the wise older brother to the rest of the world, made out to look like morons. IRRITATED me intensely. The US President (a black one which I liked) of course is in charge and Europe as minions listen to instruction and do as they are told, as do Japan and China - IRRITATING. I was sitting waiting for some sort of scientific accuracy as to what happens in Tectonic movements, but they came up with some ridiculous ""Nuclear"" or ""Neutrino"" ray activity to penetrate the Earth, this weakening its core - RUBBISH. We move on swiftly to 2010 and now things have moved on way too fast with some kind of special vessels being built in a secret location, kept secret from the world. A world which is 2010 has such things as Twitter and MySpace as good communication tools, yet we are supposed to think that 8 massive structures being built somewhere secret will remain that way in this day and age when Iran's near revolution was broken on Twitter - IRRITATING. All the scientists are scurrying around building their humanity saving transport, with no regard to cost, that is just explained away as a ""rich Russian"" and a couple of caricature ""Arabs"" paid for the construction of these vessels - IRRITATING. The way this film just explains things so simply was MADDENING! John Cusack is a divorced man working as a chauffeur for rich, yes, you got it, Russians"", how convenient. He slowly begins to see strange uttering between the privileged few who have ""bought"" their way onto these vessels for Salvation and wants to find out more. So, naturally he goes with his 2 kids to Yellowstone Park in his truck for a camping overnighter, he strays into a previously free to the public area, now fenced off, he jumps over the fence with absolutely no security there to stop him and wander into what was once a lake area. Here he is apprehended and meets the main Scientist who conveniently has read one of his books - IRRELEVANT - now is apparent to the plot is completely awash with errors and forgotten loose ends that aren't tied up in any way later on in the ""film"". Why bring things in if they had no intention of developing the fact that John Cusack's character was a rather under rated author, after this mention, the matter of him being an author and actually a chauffeur as a supplementary job, goes out the window - PLOT IRRITATION.

The special effects are top notch. So breathtaking, intense and gripping that at times I found myself sitting at the edge of my seat. The main premise is the usual mix, with a family, a scientist and the president of the United States all struggling to make it through the end of the Earth. The latter two stories are filled with clich Ãs and very predictable. However, I did feel emotionally connected to the angle regarding John Cusack and his on screen family's struggle to survive - and since they were the main focus of the story anyway, it worked well in my book. Also, throughout the film there is an incredible sense of urgency, which contributed greatly to the build up.The story is your basic end-of-the-world chaos thingy. This time around, the Earth's crusts are shifting - causing earthquakes and volcano eruptions on a global scale, followed by unfriendly tsunami waves. The governments of the world have some sort of a solution, in the shape of giant ships located in China (not spoiling anything here, this is said from the beginning of the film and is indicated in the trailer as well), and the movie follows the family's journey towards their destination, en route to China. As expected, they manage to flee and escape most of the horrific events happening around them and stay intact. Meanwhile, we get to see most of the world's biggest iconic monuments get destroyed in vivid ways - including The White House, the Jefferson Memorial, the Christ the Redeemer statue in Brazil, the Vatican in Rome and many many more.As indicated earlier, a main reason the film worked for me was the emotional connection I felt towards some of the characters. The cast here is top notch, including some recognizable actors like Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Danny Glover, Oliver Platt, Amanda Peet - and of course, John Cusack. The cast seemed as if they were having a great time shooting this film, including some necessary tongue-in-cheek implications. Never the less, many philosophical and emotional elements of redemption and survival of the fittest were also added into the mix - making 2012 a better film than it had the right to be. Sometimes, one might even forget that the chances these events will all happen at once are small at best. Now, if only the clich Ãs were a bit less over-the-top and the premise less predictable, this could have been one hell of a masterpiece. But then again, even when 2012 doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the table, it's still one hell of a roller coaster ride __ and an excellent winter blockbuster to close the year with.

This film was racist & idiotic. I am really glad this is Emmerich's last film. He seems to have lost his touch.Neither John Cusack's candy floss image, nor Amanda Peet's oomph manage to salvage a film that was meant to survive solely on mind-blowing special effects.

Maybe it's middle age (it's his first apocalypse since he turned 50). Or, maybe, it's because to a consummate destroyer of worlds (four doomsdays and counting), the true end of days is really just the final dreary step. Few images, after all, beat that of the California coast crumbling into the ocean like a sinking aircraft carrier, or of the subsequent barrage of flaming volcanic rock that pummels the earth when Yellowstone finally goes kaput, blowing its literal top and the audience's already torpid movie-going mind. Both of those sequences are given high prominence in ""2012,"" though neither is predicted by the end of the Mesoamerican long-count calendar, from which this movie takes its name if not much else. Weaving escapist fantasy into scientific fact has long been the prerogative of high-concept vehicles like ""2012,"" which omit most of the finer factual details (the Mayans never actually wrote of the end of the world, for starters) to make their own pseudoscientific conceits appear frighteningly plausible. That may explain why ""2012"" takes a nominally more scientific approach to the cataclysm (neutrinos, crust displacement, blah, blah, blah), though even Chiwetel Ejiofor, as the president's scientific adviser, seems to know that it's all one big joke long before Woody Harrelson, as some sort of apocalyptic hippie fanatic, can pop his eyeballs and declare, ""It's the apocalypse, man!""Mr. Harrelson's character doesn't figure much into the story beyond the usual wise fool archetype, though at least his bug-eyed mugging gives oomph to what is otherwise a pretty unremarkable disaster flick. The real selling point of ""2012"" is, of course, the annihilation of our planet and most of our species, and, if nothing else, the destruction here can hardly be called boring. That's to be expected, seeing that Mr. Emmerich is certainly an old hand in the industry, having already vaporized, trampled, flooded and frozen the planet solid, not to mention raked in a collective ten-figure sum at the domestic box office. Considering the worldwide scale of ""2012"" and Mr. Emmerich's incurable tendency to one-up himself, it's also no surprise that here he works so relentlessly to cover all his catastrophic bases, from the pulverization of the Vatican to the inundation of D.C., to the purely extraneous sight of a cruise ship keeling over, Paul Gallico-style, upending the galley and its many digitally- rendered flailing human bodies.But, seriously, what's the point anymore? Like most apocalyptic trifles, ""2012"" trades on the doomsday scenario to stake the usual forgettable claims at the resilience of the human spirit (and the American nuclear family) but mostly it just wants to watch the world burn, sometimes literally. The human race is ending, after all, and if that end never really resonates in ""2012,"" it's because not even Mr. Emmerich seems interested in examining it beyond the visceral level. Although he duly taps his emotional well by occasionally bringing you close to the calamity __ the tiny human bodies tumbling from a collapsing freeway are certainly frightening __ it's hard to feel awed by or even care at all about any of it when all the man wants to do (and wants us to do) is have a good time. ""2012"" is a pretty much a romp, then, and, for its first ruinous hour at least, a reasonably satisfying one. The sturdy B-movie screenplay by Mr. Emmerich and Harold Kloser actually picks up in 2009, giving time to introduce a few of the leading men and women who will figure into the imminent end, some of them likable (Mr. Ejiofor), others abhorrent (Oliver Platt as a blustering government bigwig), most of them just plain boring. Three years later, as the cracks in the Earth and the story become wider and more worrisome, more people come into play, in this case an everyfamily (John Cusack, Amanda Peet and their two burdensome children) we're meant to follow while modern civilization crumbles around them, in increasingly spectacular ways. But the spectacle wears off and the movie soon drags, done in when Mr. Emmerich's exuberant flair for devastation gives way to his seriously underwhelming affinity for family soap operatics and teary moments of worldwide harmony. Part of the problem with movies like ""2012"" is that even with the latest brand of pricey computer-generated effects at their disposal, such wizardry tends to undercut itself when you stop and realize that almost none of what you're seeing is really there, really happening. Mr. Emmerich is not entirely to blame, of course, though it's nonetheless a wonder that after three stabs at destroying the planet, he still can't avoid the disconnect between human tragedy and worldwide destruction that runs through ""2012"" like a fissure and keeps even its most realistic-looking disasters from ever feeling remotely real. Which may make it the perfect tonic to this particular ploy of the paranoia market. ","  knew  end   world     bummer?

On a recent episode of Family Guy, Brian gets a earful of truth serum from Quagmire and the last thing (of many) Quagmire said was: ""You know what, I could forgive all of that, all of that, if you weren't such a bore.""I forgave a lot of what was wrong in 2012 but the one thing I couldn't bypass is that it was such a bore. And that was the one thing that surprised me the most. Even knowing it was way too long at over 2_Ã¢ hours, I didn't expect such Pearl Harbor moments that made me yawn and wonder what the heck were they thinking?What I did know, was how silly it was from the 5-minute internet-released trailer. I figured I would laugh, or at least snicker at some of the scenes. I found myself doing that at more than one occasion, and it wasn't the blatant and unrealistic destruction scenes. It was just how bad this movie was, when they tried to show ""heart"" or ""feeling"" or ""warmth."" Or at the consistent ""near-misses"" for our, uh, so-called, ""heroes."" Or the number of plane dipping.Despite the sometimes good special effects __ I honestly can't justify giving it an extra half star for that due to the overwhelming negatives, I will say this in the movie's favor: I didn't snicker or laugh out loud as many times as I thought I would. (Side note: I watched both Twilight and The Happening because I was in the mood for a comedy and for the most part, I did laugh heartedly throughout those two films.) In this film, I was just simply bored. And also previously mentioned, this movie was so Pearl Harbor, where there were just a few scenes of mass-destruction, the reason people would want to see this mess or the reason they made it, and the rest was just plain awful. Awful, awful, awful and terribly bad.Shame on you, Cusack. Selling out. Again, that is. You could've been one of my all-time favorite actors. It all started going downhill since Con Air. Sure, he's had one or two good movies since, such as 1408. (Weird, perhaps he should choose more wisely for movie titles that contain only four digits.)Following Emmerich's very similar The Day After Tomorrow, a million things completely impossible happen within a matter of days. Here we have the very wrong theory of 12/21/12 where the Mayan calendar ends and the world as we know it shifts axis, thus destroying all mankind and man's kind of civilization. Enter in the very stereotypical divorced dad (Cusack here, Quaid in Tomorrow) and his ex, his kids, the new beau__the whole cast is recycled sitcom/disaster-movie characters.But__that's not what you bought a ticket for, right? It was to see big explosions. Am I right? Well, unfortunately, they're so few and far between, it's hard to justify a recommendation __ heck, it's like 40+ minutes before anything happens. And what's worse, is the fake ""heart-filled"" scenes and really, really, REALLY bad jokes and puns.Okay, this movie is fairly, make that enormously easy to ridicule. It wasn't made to earn Oscars __ though I am sure it's going to be up for special effects, but come on. Try a little bit. Try to show real emotion, real dialogue, real people. Do something memorable.I expect this out of Michael Bay. He cares more about using gasoline to explode stuff than character development, genuine thrills, emotion and plot development. Though Emmerich is only a half a step higher, he will genuinely win the contests between the two buffoons. Here, he not only matches Bay's horrible movie-making qualities, he almost takes the prize away from Transformers 2 as the worst of 2009.To sum up, this movie is all disaster movies in one: Armageddon, The Day After Tomorrow, Poseidon, Pearl Harbor, Independence Day, Deep Impact, Dante's Peak and many more. Heck, it mimicked Wall-E, and I should be shot for stating that. It has horrible acting, clich Ãs (oh, the clich Ãs!), dialogue, comedy and thee most unrealistic scenes of flight ever on film. I mean, really, how many lives do these nobodies have? How many times do we have to see a plane dip? Seriously, how many coincidences and luck-outs do this boring broken family have?I think this was sincerely made for only two types of people: those who actually believe 12/21/12 is the end (ha ha ha ha ha __ I've said this before, but I sincerely don't believe in this ""end of time"" conspiracy theory, but even if I am wrong, I'll be dead with everyone else, so who cares?) and for those who just blindly want to see millions die as buildings collide. To each their own, but I appreciate a movie-goer who appreciates film as an art and not as mindless special effects engine.And the joke's on you people. Both kinds. But, speaking specifically to the later group, you'll get like maybe 30 minutes out of 158 of what you paid your money for. I'm glad you'll have to suffer through the rest, for the low taste you have.(Okay, that last part was harsh. Again, to each their own. But each ticket sold __ like the never-ending Saw series, justifies these crappy movies. I have made it a point to cease watching the Saw movies for this very reason: I have to stop being part of the problem. For the money I spend, I expect more. And with less tickets sold, Hollywood might actually take notice.)

What was a good idea (though it was the same good idea we saw in Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow... and so many other films of this nature) had potential. There was a lot of money behind this thing, obviously, but it would appear that all this money went towards the effects. The effects are stellar for the most part, but are so over done that you truly feel the extent to which the filmmakers failed in every other way. The plot is dumb, the acting, with the notable exception of Woody Harrelson playing... himself, is hard to watch, and the effects, believe it or not, are not worth it. I say this not because they were anything short of amazing, but because there is so much effect that you find yourself sick of it. It's not always easy to sit through a brainless movie without good effects. But it's quite difficult to sit through a near 3-hour movie with only effects. The film had nothing else to offer. The attempts to ask moral and ethical question are skewed and ineffective. The characters are so expendable, as you will quickly discover, that it's nearly impossible to care about them. And the few characters that you do end up caring about are the ones that the filmmakers seemed to care the least about, and so they get very little screen time. The camera work is alright at times, though there are a few awkward switches between techniques.If you, however, are only looking for a way to kill three hours, and you have not seen a lot of movies like this before, perhaps 2012 is for you. If you're looking for anything more to this film, though, you will likely be thoroughly disappointed. Don't spend 10 dollars on this, rent it on DVD, watch it on a big HD screen and huff a lot of propane, and this movie will be your favorite film of all time.It is a bit sad, because I must say that Emmerich's films in the past, particularly Independence Day, were quite good. This one just isn't.Hopefully Hollywood will figure out that bigger budget isn't always better movie... someday.

More to the point, why did so many talented actors sign up for it?Where to start? Well, okay the special effects are gob-smackingly good. I mean truly brilliant - but sadly that's all that this film has going for it, and after 30 minutes that's not enough to stop you looking for the exit.The story starts reasonably well, albeit with all of the usual disaster movie clich Ãs. Things take a wrong turn pretty fast though and by the time the first of the holes in the ground appear you're wishing that the Earth had opened up and swallowed the scriptwriter and producers instead. One over the top improbable special effects sequence follows another, and whilst they are audio-visual feasts, I wish even one tenth of the same effort had gone into writing a script that didn't hit every cloyingly saccharine clich Ã ever to come out of Hollywood. I mean truly - you'll cringe at almost every line.The actors seem to be running brain-in-neutral, like they too can't wait for the film to finish. I can see them all thinking the same thing; ""whatever, this is a piece of c**p, but that paycheck has some nice zeroes on it and Madoff did kinda screw us."" John Cusack is one of my favourite actors, but an hour in even I couldn't care less if he died or not. There was just no heart in his acting. Danny Glover was passable, but totally mis-cast as the President. The show-stealer was Oliver Platt who gave an excellent performance as the jaded, cynical politico who is the main antagonist of the film. You really believe in his character and find yourself agreeing with him whilst all the other characters run around spouting unbelievably cheesy platitudes. Woody Harrelson is sadly underused, and his crackpot character given too much credence by John Cusack's protagonist. The other performances are largely forgettable.But the worst - the absolute worst thing - about this film is the lack of any pretence of reality in the story. Ridiculous doesn't even begin to cover it. Over the top is par for course especially in disaster movies, but this one really aims for the stars. It massively overindulges itself, and you find yourself rolling your eyes as science is left for dust and the end of the possibility curve is but a distant memory as each new set-piece rolls out on its embarrassingly ludicrous premise. The clincher is the Cistine Chapel sequence, where one shot - you'll know it when you see it - just had everybody in my cinema groaning and rolling their eyes. After that, it didn't matter how good the visual effects were, because the suspension of disbelief - perilously thin as it was up until then - was totally lost and the audience started looking at their watches and wondering if the football highlights might be more entertaining.So, the good in this film boils down to the visual effects and Oliver Platt. Everything else is either dire, forgettable, or just totally unmemorable. I can't even comment on the score because I genuinely can't remember anything of it.The only reason I could think of to recommend this film is as an example of how bad the genre can be. You'd be hard pressed to find worse; Armageddon, Independence Day, Poseidon, Volcano, Dante's Peak and Day After Tomorrow are all far better than this. That should give you an indicator of how much you need to body-swerve this flick. ","    film ever get made?    point,    many talented actors sign   it?Where  start?

The only significant difference with this movie is that this time the disaster takes place globally. The movie suffers from overly dramatic scenes that drag on far too long and have no appeal what so ever. I think they could have easily cut out a good 30 minutes or so of soap-opera esq scenes.The acting in this movie is very below average, to the point that its almost embarrassing to watch. No matter what the situation, the cast always seems very unenthusiastic in their roles and the sometimes plain uninspired dialog doesn't exactly help either. I think the movie would have worked out a lot better if they would have taken a more adventurous approach with the story. Now 2012 turned out like a movie that relies too much on special-effects. But if its special-effects you want, you will be pretty bored with this movie as well I think, because 2012 has little other redeeming features to offer.Director Roland Emmerich said that 2012 will be his final disaster- movie, and frankly this is a very good thing before his movies turn out even more disastrous then this movie. 2012 is a very mediocre and in the end forgettable film.

But no, it is just a bad disaster movie.SPOILER ALERT How many time can a person outrun the earth shattering and quaking beneath them? Apparently, John Cusack can do it about 6 times, and on the 3rd time he was in a plane that just narrowly made it off the ground and just narrowly missed buildings that were collapsing around it, well, I was talking to the screen by then and saying ""seriously? again?"" And can I just say the special effects weren't that great either, I have definitely seen better, and once you have seen one city crashing to the ground and one tidal wave, it's time for something new.I love John Cusack too - HE was the reason I wanted to see this movie, and to be truthful he was the only reason I watched until the end because his character (2 dimensional though it was), was the only one I actually cared enough about to see what happened.George Seagal (spelling may be wrong here!), but he was actually in this movie - no idea why, he had a trivial little part as an entertainer on a cruise ship. SPOILER COMING NOW - the cruise ship is in dock (right at the beginning of the movie), and it starts to rock wildly and in a very scary fashion before it leaves harbor - why would you not get off the boat? Seriously, no one in their right mind would stay on the boat after that, but no they stayed. There was some other trivial little aside where George calls his son who he doesn't speak to, but who really cared at all about that, it was inconsequential.SPOILER AGAIN - they wiped out LA at one point, but there didn't seem to be too much concern in other parts of the USA at that point, or the rest of the world, so it was all very emotionless at times, and that isn't what a good disaster movie is supposed to be about.In Independence Day we cared if the darn dog made it into the side tunnel - we cared about the crazy drunk crop spraying pilot - we cared about the president, etc.Danny Glover was wasted in this movie, as was Oliver Platt - they were almost cartoon like, cardboard characters with no depth at all.They should have concentrated on John Cusack's character and had him find out about the conspiracy theory (Woody Harrelson's cameo side story), find out about the arks, work at it that way and give you small pieces of the rest of the story and show the horror from his family's POV as they saw what was happening to the world.Instead, what we got was a hodge podge of set pieces, with so-so special effects (nothing we haven't seen before), a groan-worthy script, and a whole load of great actors who got hung out to dry by a director who seemed more concerned with destroying buildings, and blowing stuff up to make loud noises for the Dolby sound, than he was concerned about making a darned good story.Deep Impact was not a particularly good movie, and unfortunately 2012 is on the same par. I don't blame the actors, it's all Emmerich's fault and I hope someone else comes out with a movie about the same topic, since it is still relevant, and makes a real attempt to construct a story that will at once be terrifying in its possibilities and thoroughly entertaining.This is one movie definitely more deserving of a Redbox rental than a box office ticket!

This movie was SO HORRIBLE, I actually took notes to describe exactly WHAT is so bad or inaccurate about it.First, when John and his children walk into the dried up lake area, the military comes out of nowhere, along with a helicopter! How original! It's not like I haven't seen this in 8 THOUSAND other movies before!So I figured, okay maybe that was a fluke, every movie has something cheesy about it.That was..... Until I started noticing the one character with the stupid Indian accent, that really took a very short time to get annoying, because OF COURSE the director of this movie has to literally flood this movie with cultural diversity.... Otherwise people might accidentally confuse him with a racist somehow..... The movie was also loaded to the ceiling with stupid catch phrases, clich Ã lines and totally obvious moments, that every 5 seconds you swear you've seen this movie somewhere before! Not to mention the bad acting ALMOST makes you forget about all of this.The one thing that really got on my nerves was the continuously lame attempts at drawing out little dramatic moments. For example, whenever there was a silent or boring moment in the film, out of nowhere comes a military chopper sound just screaming for your attention! And of course then you see the helicopter fly right by the screen or in the background! How original, I bet he stayed up for endless nights and lost massive amounts of sleep coming up with that million dollar idea!The movie is also loaded with tons of unrealistic sound effects, like when the floor starts to crack in the supermarket, you hear a "" tearing "" noise.....hmmmmm...... The only way I can explain this logically is, the director is completely deaf, or just doesn't care.Danny Glover is in this movie, which is great, but his assistant needs acting lessons and might want to step into a NYC comedy club once in a while, since he obviously has forgotten what a ""joke"" is, because he is not funny.... Basically I'm not even going to make a joke about him, because I'd probably feel like I was making fun of a retarded person.This movie had an excellent idea, take an actual apocalyptic scenario from Myan carvings, and put it into action.... And since the Myans actually believed the world would end in 2012, their calenders ended at such date. It's sad such an original premise of a movie had to come to such a silly fate at the hands of this so called director.Another thing I noticed was, when they were driving off in the limousine trying to escape the ground shattering beneath them, was the fact that his limo sounded exactly like an 1980's Ferrari GTO....... Instead of.....maybe a LIMO!And when they try to pilot the plane, they find that one guy who says the Oh-So-Popular Hollywood line......."" oh not me! I've only taken a few lessons!!!"" Please don't even get me started on that one.And WTF is up with the plane scene in general!? I was actually confused as if I was watching a pathetic action movie, or Star Wars! I seriously almost died laughing at how STUPID that scene was.Besides, they pull the plane up to a frigging gas station and just fill up, like it's there moms Honda accord! That plane required Jet A, NOT gasoline! Not to mention, that plane would NEVER be able to fly on regular pump gas, even IF it was a piston aircraft. Piston aircraft require at least 110 LL octane just to fly. Obviously the highest octane the average stations carry is 93 octane, which would still be extremely dangerous to do.But every story has a surprise, and mine is no exception.The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars, was because of Woody Harrelson. He was THAT funny.....This movie is the attention-whore of Doomsday Action movies. It does absolutely nothing short of sell itself out to bad acting, ridiculously fake action sequences and incredibly dull humorous moments.This movie is horrible, period.....

After all the publicity and promotion around it I must say I was really curious to find out what could be happening to the world if all the prophecies reveal to be true. Also, Rolland Emerich directed one of my favorite films, one of those films I always watch as if it was the first time: ""The Day After Tomorrow"". John Cusack also helped.But let me be honest with you, it's really been a long long time since I felt like going out of the cinema after the first half hour of a film. But that happened last night. I think I'm a bit of a masochist for watching it till the end, but I had spent money on it (and was not alone) and I had to see if there was still something that could save this disaster (the film, not what happened to the world).Apart from the visual effects of the worlds destruction that created some really powerful images, all the film, after the plot reaches the year 2012, is filled with some lame and others the most ridiculous, really unimaginable and implausible, not likely to happen situations. No human, in a million years would escape all the main characters managed to escape (or be so lucky) till they reached a ""safe harbor"". Maybe in the world of comics, some kind of super-heroes would be able to do that. Contrary to ""The Day After Tomorrow"", I mentioned before, where Mr.Emerich showed and balanced both the catastrophe and the human struggle to survive sides, all in the right measures without destroying the story and the all film.Some might say it's a film, it's not real and the main characters should always manage to get to end safe and sound, but if I wanted to see what I saw there I'd go see X-Men or some other film of the kind. I know it's a catastrophe film, but the people are real, the mankind is real, and I would like to see that there would be some kind of truth and reality in it.My 3/10 goes out to John Cusack and Woody Harrelson and, as I said, to some of the visual effects.

Yet horror movie stars are of the dumb variety and they want to see what made that deadly sounding noise.Disaster movies work because whilst the setting is mostly science fiction, the reactions are at the very least humanly possible. Here everything is just done with an extra level of dumbness. This completely ruins the whole story. I don't want to give spoilers so I'm not going to state any of these happenings, but trust me, not one moment of this movie is believable.

There are systems that we have been told are gone forever that suddenly work just to create another emotional scene - of which there are plenty, but none that works. Cusack's character is hailed as a hero for nearly killing everybody. They try the emotional President speech but Danny Glover doesn't pull it off due to both the writing & acting.

People do not drive through collapsing buildings or collapsing freeway bridges. Guys with two beginner's flight lessons cannot pilot anything, let alone giant specially designed Russian planes.

There are simply way too many major problems to settle on one! But possibly the over-arching problem is that it used way too many end-of-the-world formulas and plot devices. In fact, it strived to ensure that none were left out.We had: 1) An last second escape as the world is collapsing around them.... Well in fact we had that about nine times. Worse still, I think they took off in a plane while the runway collapsed three times in total. 2) A madman predicting the end of the world, proves to be right and plays a role in the survival of others. But the question remains: what was Woody thinking signing up for this crap ?3) An unsuspecting hero.4) The hero back helping his ex escape just as disaster strikes and winding up back in a relationship with her at the end.5) A lovable cuddly character who dies tragically. (Yuri)6) A pet that was unnecessarily saved. 7) A completely unnecessary dramatic emergency right at the end where our hero survives a suicide mission and saves the day.8) An expert no one would believe until it was almost too late.9) A president with no first lady (aka ID4 and Deep Impact) who is overly sentimental and pulls an enormously patriotic act.10) Interconnecting characters - notice how so many of the characters intersect before disaster strikes.11) An almost semi-evil, overly ruthless government player. Oliver Platt's character traits were unnecessary and the stand off he has with geological expert in front of world leaders at the end was cringe worthy and embarrassing. 12) Implausibility - with days of warning, we expect airforce one to be loaded with fuel. But the president stays behind, the vice president is caught somewhere at dies, the speaker of the house...well... he's running late.. So that of course, leaves the world in the hands of Oliver Platt. 13) Father reconnecting with children despite the relationship being rocky at the start.The only different thing about this film was that the film makers had no issue killing off certain characters you would expect to live and keeping alive those you thought would die. The should have drowned Platt. Yet I was expecting the survival of Yuri, the Russian pilot, Yuri's little blonde chic. I also expected the ex-wife's new boyfriend to survive, though I suppose it make it easier for the hero to get back together with his ex-wife if the current boyfriend is crushed and squashed between two rotors! By the end of the film, I wished those two rotors crushed and squashed up the producers, scripwriters, actors and any other significant film maker involved in this pile of utter crap.

Actually, that's the entire plot, so maybe this should be considered a spoiler.Estimates are that this movie cost about $260 million to make. I guess a quarter-billion dollars just doesn't buy what it used to. It's roughly twice what Roland Emmerich squandered on ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" which is apropos, I suppose, since ""2012"", believe it or not, is every bit of twice as bad as ""Day After."" I'm not even sure where to start, but writing is always a good launching point. ""2012"" is a careening, convoluted cacophony of practically every possible disaster movie clich Ã. We have the usual ticking clock, a common literary device, arbitrarily accelerated when the writer/director felt a need to heighten the tension. We have flat, transparent characters who end up being little more than placeholders around which to construct the endless, tiresome special effects. And, of course, we have the special effects, so shamelessly and randomly contrived as to render the destruction of the world tedious. I ended up wishing the world would hurry up and end already, but no, there had to be yet another, and another, and another, plot twist; inartfully conceived, predictably staged, and completely inert.The cast fared no better. John Cusak is one of my favorite actors, but he had no character to portray. Do we really need another hack writer, failed husband derelict trying to remain relevant in the lives of his children vis-a-vis mommy's new, rich husband? The kids were just two-dimensional cutout characters - mere props in the CGI scenery. Danny Glover, a passable character actor, was completely out of his depth as The Last President of the United States. Even George Bush seemed competent and intelligent by comparison. Oliver Platt, Thandie Newton, Amanda Peet, Woody Harrelson - all fine actors, were lost within characters lacking even a hint of humanity or depth.The only thing this movie has going for it, although obviously not what Emmerich intended, is that it is pathetically funny. We laughed till our sides hurt as we called out each and every plot device before they were hauled out with all the subtlety of a train wreck and the unfailing predictability of an atomic clock. What's worse, each new twist was more ridiculous than the last until, as we roared with laughter, the entire Earth itself was conveniently shifted at the exact moment and extent necessary to start another cycle of completely absurd events.""2012"" is epically bad, monumentally stupid, and cataclysmically boring.

Whether you love him or loathe him, ""2012"" is his disaster epic, with plenty of spectacular scenes of destruction, a determined band of survivors (led by John Cusack as struggling writer Jackson Curtis) trying to live through the end of the world. Some scientific babble about the sun's rays heating up the Earth's core and loosening up the Earth's tectonic plates and shifting the poles has sped up doomsday from its predicted date (by the Mayans) of 12-21-12 to some time during the summer of 2012. Scenes of destruction are nothing new in movies like this. But what makes it all so very different is that the destruction on the scale as presented in ""2012"" is unprecedented in the movies. The scenes of mega-tsunamis engulfing Washington, D.C., and India, the super-volcano underneath Yellowstone National Park suddenly erupting, and Los Angeles (and pretty much the entire West Coast falling into the Pacific Ocean) are not only spectacular and awesome to look at, but are also harrowing and horrifying. I'm not a fan of the disaster movie genre, but the scenes of such mass death and destruction in ""2012"" are so unusually affecting and horrifying that I actually had a hard time watching it, but I couldn't look away. I don't know if that was intended or not by Emmerich, but if he wanted to scare the hell out of the audience, I think that in my case he succeeded in shaking me to my emotional core, and wondering if this is what the end of the world will really look like. While I don't think the world will end on 12-21-12 - I've read enough articles and discussions on the matter to convince me otherwise - there is no question, however, that ""2012"" may very well be the disaster epic of the disaster movie genre.10/10 "," ""2012""   2009 disaster epic   ""master  disaster"" Roland Emmerich (""Independece Day"" -  best film,   opinion  ""Godzilla""   "" Day  Tomorrow"").

There has been enough written about how dire this whole film really is.Onto the promise, 2012 feels like a prequel to something much more interesting, the arcs are full now, there is a definite Orwellian feel to the surveillance on board and definite resentment toward leadership, and a definite class structure between those who paid and those who just got a place.

The first 45 minutes went fine, within reason as the picture set the scene for doomsday but once the action sequences started, I was spitting out my popcorn for the wrong reasons.

That was the state I was in while entering the theater to watch 2012. Excitingly waiting for the movie to start, I had many questions in mind about how the director will tackle the various ongoing problems of the world while showcasing the Ultimate End of our civilization? And majorly what will be his take on the famous religions of the world when the characters will be talking about their Final Moments? And to my surprise the movie took off from our part of the world in 1999, where an Indian Geologist religiously named Dr. Satnam, discovers that the Earth is heating up to an extent that is causing a shift in its tectonic plates. He passes on the news of this deadly discovery to his American friend Dr. Adria, who straight away takes it to the White House as an emergency situation. Coming back to the future in 2012, the movie plunges into the amazing graphical world where the earth is sinking due to the high density earthquakes and all the historical monuments are falling left and right like lifeless toys.Visually it's a fabulous portrayal of the End of the World from the director ""Roland Emmerich"" who is known for his mesmerizing work in his earlier movies such as ""Independence Day"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""Godzilla"". The moment you witness the first shattering sequence of the earth making a huge wide gap and everything falling into it, you get transported into a gripping enigmatic world altogether. The spectacular special effects unfolding every 15 minutes in the movie, just keep you glued to the screen with your jaws wide open. The disastrous happenings worldwide, the enormous water tides coming over, the burning volcanic eruptions and ugly tsunamis spreading over the world map just bring on the viewer to the edge of his seat.Hence, if you are in for some great Computer Graphics and want to see a few terrific nail biting scenes where the heroes are just climbing up before the earth sinks in, then this is the perfect choice to spend your valuable time.But if you are expecting a great movie, rich on emotional and futuristic content as suggested by the impressive body of work by its director, then you may remain quite unsatisfied at the end. In simple words, 2012, undoubtedly scores high on technical and graphical terms but content wise it falls short of the earlier disaster movies from the director. It lacks the emotional depth in its characterization due to which the viewer is not able to relate with any of the characters fighting with the unwanted situation. In order to cover more number of people on the screen, the script fails to develop any one character in particular, which as a result leaves a very cold kind of impact on the viewer. The movie also tends to become a bit slow at times but bounces back with every new destruction sequence on the screen.The entire cast delivers fine performances as required by the subject, but they are also handicapped by the poor characterization in the script. John Cusack is pleasant to see but has nothing great written for him in particular. Amanda Peet is just there to give her constant looks of amazement. Danny Glover as the president, Thandie Newton as his daughter, Oliver Platt as the president's chief of staff and Jimi Mistry as Dr. Satnam simply play their parts as directed. Only Chiwetel Ejiofor looks like more concerned about the humanity factor in the movie and makes an impact.2012 also tends to be repetitive in few sequences which strongly give you a feeling of ""seen before"". The movie even reminded me one of the early 80's disaster movies called ""Earthquake"". In fact this time, Emmerich also seems to be inspired by his own masterpieces from the past. He surely surpasses them all in terms of mass destruction of the globe, but talking about the rich emotional quotient of those Hit movies, 2012 comparatively scores quite low. Emmerich, intentionally skips many important questions related to various countries and religions practiced by different people residing all over the globe.The main drawback of the movie is that even though it revolves around the concept of end of the world and its civilization, still it is unable to frighten you with the scary thought. The movie keeps on impressing you with its exceptional execution constantly but at the same time, fails to take you in on emotional grounds. In a nutshell, it's a film very rich in the Cinematography and Computer Graphics department, but is also quite unimpressive in its content.Interestingly the movie ends with a clear message to the World and its entire population. It simply says that ""Now is the time that we all have to unite together at the earliest or else the nature will unite us deliberately in its own destructive way.""

The film is full of clich Ãs, the father separated from the children's mother and has to deal with the jealousy of his kids liking their new step-father. Characters (who running for their lives to get in yet another getaway vehicle) will stop to say a ""funny"" one liner that is about as appropriate as giving cheese burger with extra cheese to an acute lactose intolerance sufferer. The film also suffers from what I like to call the ""Armageddon factor"" where the director thinks that constantly throwing near miss after very improbable near miss very 10 seconds will make the film intense, on the edge of your seat nail biting. It doesn't, it makes the film boring and predictable. I can't for the life me understand why it's got such a high rating on here (5.8 at the time of writing). As I joked with a friend ""from this day onwards every single precious second is a bonus and needs to be cherished... and I've just wasted 534,600 of them on this pile of poo (not the word I used but you know what I meant)"". The positive of this film is, the visual effect. They are absolutely stunning. The scene where they take off in plane fly along a newly form gorge with the buildings of L.A.

I mean, are you really gonna sit still and argue about the right and wrong of humanity and risk lives in the process when you can move your butt and save some instead?

One where people flee the planet but some stay behind. Those that stayed behind and survived start over with new laws, leadership, culture, beliefs, etc. Those that fled and return have to conform to these new ways and accept their new position in the world since the old way is unacceptable now and the old guard has no power.

Along with Shia Labeouf, Emmerich ranks as one of the two most inexplicable people coming out of Hollywood in my entire lifetime. All they would have to do is get together for a project and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" will no longer be the worst movie ever made.To be honest, I did not even know that this film was directed by him at first. But it didn't take long before it became obvious who was behind the camera. It had the same warm fuzzy feeling that all other Emmerich movies have, yet still manages to fail at making an emotional connection with the viewer. He just puts a few basic dramatic elements together, adds a shallow attempt at political commentary, dubs in some melodramatic music, then pours on the special effects. That in a nutshell is the official Emmerich formula (also see Independence Day, Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow).As for the characters, there are basically four types in the majority of his films. The first three are unbelievable a-holes in power, cool old men who are fathers of the protagonists and crazy, but intelligent nut cases. Most others fall into the third category as passionate and sensitive wimps who always do just the right thing even if it is completely stupid.

Not because it is terrible or hackneyed or lazy, but because it is none of those things. It is actually pretty effective. Annoyingly so.Why I even chose to pick 2012 off the rack I'll never know but one way or the other it made it to my pad and sat happily in the DVD tray for 157 minutes(!) while I hated myself for actually not hating the film, which is at least 30 minutes long by the way.So the film. Scientists do sciency things and perform sciency type tests. The upshot of the matter is it appears that the human race is soon to be forked, as in stick a fork in it, we're done. This is relayed to the Prez of the U.S.A. (Danny Glover. A BLACK Prez? Yeah right!) who initially sez let's keep this on the low-low.Meanwhile Jackson (John Cusack), an author/limo-driver (now there's a winning combo!) picks up his two kids from the ex-missus for their Daddy-Kids weekend that is to be spent camping in a National Park__ Let me just zip through 90 minutes of not much by saying that after meeting a scientist who has the answers but ain't telling, and a pot smoking hippie played by Woody Harrelson (WHAT A STRETCH!) who claims to have the answers__ but who can trust a pot smoking hippie? Jackson, kids, the ex and her current hubbie end up fleeing the West Coast of the US as it crumbles and falls around them.The benefit of CGI is that they can be shown just evading certain death in dramatic fashion. The pitfall of CGI is when they do it 77 times over an hour constant near death becomes a little dull.Roland has the nous to show enough famous landmarks going under so that the audience can identify them and say ""Oh, we went there honey!"". This always annoys me but what can you do? In Independence Day it was the WhiteHouse, in The Day After Tomorrow it was the Statue of Liberty (Yeah I didn't see it but it was on the cover and trailer), and here it is a variety of well known locales and landmarks.It turns out the well-to do and those in the know are all heading to China where a Plan Z is in effect, so Jackson and hangers-on hitch a ride with Jackson's mega billionaire employer, a Russian mogul for whom he chaufferred and off they go. Once in China they realize that not all will be admitted and that sacrifices must be made so that many can survive. But do they need to all die or are some decisions made so that the wealthy have more legroom? There are weasely politicians who do weasely things, especially as the deadline approaches, good people who make the ""Big"" decisions and try to convince others of the ""right things to do"", and the usual coincidences that keep embroiling Jackson and co right in the middle of the action.The film is essentially a big SFX extravaganza like Titanic and Avatar, you can see exactly where the money went. Like Titanic it is an overlong film with near miss after near miss that gradually gets stale and loses impact, but unlike Avatar this just doesn't have the ""WOW"" factor that gets you moving around in your seat.Near the end I asked myself just how many near misses I could take before I started rooting for nature and natural disasters to take 'em out. Fortunately one of the redeeming factors is that the kids aren't just little smarmy sh*ts, in fact further to being merely tolerable near the end Jackson and son have a ""serious"" chat that was actually surprisingly effective__ Then something exploded, some people screamed and we were back to business.Final Rating __ 6 / 10. If this really was the end of the world I'd want then to hurry it along. 2 _Ã¢ hours of disaster gets on my last nerve! The film is frustratingly effective for reasonable periods though.

It would've been insulting to the audience's intelligence if they just said here is the disaster, it is happening, with no explanation as to why. Then there is an interesting build-up and we get to see some interesting and thought provoking scenes.But then the disaster starts to strike, and Jackson has to escape from it and at this point the producers expect you to go into mindless mode, stop asking questions, stop thinking and just watch our expensive and fancy special effects in a series of disaster escape scenes. And there is just to many of these escape scenes, they start to get boring. This movie goes on two and a half hours, they could have seriously cut out forty or so minutes by just getting rid of some of these mindless escape scenes, then the movie would be far better.They just introduce the audience to the idea that the poles are shifting and the world's plates are being rearranged without any satisfactory explanation, and there is immense flooding and they only spend a couple minutes talking about why this is happening. Cut out some of these action scenes and put in some more content explaining things.This movie contains a copious amount of biblical references, for example the boats are called ""Arks"", there is an immense flood that these boats escape from using their advanced technology, and there is a reference to Mount Ararat in the alternative ending. These biblical references are not explained and they assume the viewer has prior knowledge of the bible. These biblical references do not belong here.Additionally, I felt that the Yuri character did not belong here, but then again he may have been useful in conveying the point that only very rich elites will have the power to escape a disaster like this one. Overall I give this film a 5/10. This film isn't that bad, it has some relatively nice special effects but it relies on them too much rather then investing in a good thought-provoking plot.

It is then up to a lot of cantankerous civil servants, hammy world leaders, and idealistic twits (otherwise known in the Emmerich-verse as scientists) to ""ensure the continuity of our species"" by building three modern-day arks in China to preserve the fittest (or, in other words, the richest) Homo sapiens on the planet, all the while making sure that the international prole populace remain blissfully unaware of the impending Armageddon. As is the tradition for this kind of trash, the film is told primarily from the perspective of a customary 'everyman' Jackson Curtis (played with understandable indifference by John Cusack) who has the hereditary family problems (or rather 'issues') that include a nagging ex-wife called Kate (played by a surprisingly unattractive Amanda Peet); a son who belongs to a long-line of disaster film pre-adolescent/adolescent urchins who have a chronic phobia of calling their fathers 'dad'; a nauseatingly-naive daughter who can't keep her fluids to herself while engaged in REM-sleep; and a smug rival for Kate's affections called Gordon who ""doesn't do Lipo on Fridays"". Through a series of fortunate __ though for me unfortunate __ contrivances, Curtis manages to not only learn of the imminent destruction but also of the existence AND location of the supposedly top-secret arks courtesy of a derelict lunatic (Woody Harrelson, playing himself) who just happens to be associated with a great many reputable academics and geologists. From there, Curtis, his family, and the slimy Gordon (who is conveniently a natural-born pilot) desperately try to reach China before the arks, and civilisation, are cast off.The film of course possesses many subplots that are bland and uninteresting __ and often completely unnecessary __, but they are nowhere near as riddled with clich Ã and idiocy as the main one. Indeed, the second main story threat of the film __ the truly original and innovative perspective of the US president (Danny Glover doing a cheap Morgan Freeman impersonation), his daughter, his chief of staff (performed with villainous veal by Oliver Platt), and some science guy called Adrian (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, likely the only 'actor' in this film who can be deservingly called such) __ is actually sincerely poignant at moments, though still horribly theatrical at other moments.Addressing the film's mise en scene, one cannot deny that the special effects are good. I tried to, but they really are quite spectacular. It really was a joyous experience to watch Los Angeles (aka. Purgatory) fall apart, not to mention seeing the aforementioned conspiracy nut get crushed by a tree, but that really is all the film has to offer in terms of entertainment and art. The script is poor and predictable; the cinematography is extremely unimaginative; and the editing is very leisurely and lethargic. While I was not expecting Citizen Kane (you'd have to be mentally ill to have such expectations for this type of fare), or even Deep Impact, there could have at least been a greater attempt by the filmmakers to take a more earnest and intellectual approach to the material than that which can be seen in the film, especially after Emmerich's previous foray into the disaster genre, The Day After Tomorrow, had heralded such solid results.Watch it only if you have a few extra brain cells that you wouldn't mind getting ride of.

I think I can still feel my brain cells dying.I can enjoy a big, dumb movie as much as the next guy, and anyone going into ""2012"" thinking it's NOT going to be a big dumb movie deserves what he gets, but come ON. Did it have to be THIS dumb? John Cusack looks bored and embarrassed to be headlining this special effects extravaganza about the end of the world. He plays an obscure writer who leads his family to safety as the Earth's crust becomes separated from its core and starts to slip around like a loose sock. As far as I can tell, this means that the South Pole ends up where Milwaukee, Wisconsin used to be, but somehow whole mountain ranges, cities (what's left of them after mega-quakes tear them apart) and the people still living are able to just ride around the world's axis like they're on a big merry-go-round. The first action sequence is so preposterous that it leaves the film nowhere to go. Cusack, driving the best-made limo of all time, out runs a fault that is tearing Los Angeles away from the continental United States, even at one point (I'm not making this up) driving it through a building as it's collapsing(!) to end up safely on the other side. Why is it that if I tried this I'd pop a tire within two minutes? This scene, and many more like it, are played for yucks, which doesn't help. The special effects are surprisingly bad for such a high-profile movie. But the worst thing about ""2012"" is how tired it feels. Roland Emmerich is now stealing from himself, taking stray parts of his other movies and patching them together in the hopes that they'll again strike gold.The cast also includes Amanda Peet, who tries valiantly to give an actual performance, and at the other end of the spectrum, Woody Harrelson, who the Motion Picture Academy should sue for defamation.

Explosions, tidal waves, crashing buildings and catastrophe are his lingua franca. He delivers. Yet as many have pointed out, this is a deeply frustrating film. The storyline is fine, and ambitious, and there is a budget to match. The actors are solid, and the ample two and a half hour running time is more than enough to get the story told, so why the carping? In short, the story is not told well enough.The trailers allude to Mayan prophesy of the destruction of the world in 2012, yet in the film it only just gets a mention. There is no sense of ancient foretold doom. When the world starts to ""turn hot"" the global meetings are little more than an excuse to provide location shots to sell the film in different countries, and a sub plot involving the state execution of whistle-blowers poised to reveal all to an unsuspecting public appears, then disappears, to little purpose.John Cussack is a convincing hero, Danny Glover is hopelessly miscast as the American President in a horribly written role and Thandie Newton is wasted as an incidental love interest for co- hero, Chiwetel Ejiofor. Woody Harleston has a bizarre cameo as a hippy dj who knows what is going on and has the secret map that reveals all, and appears to be the sort of person to keep the kids well away from.The action scenes themselves are tremendous, but there appears to be little holding it all together. Clunkily episodic, each scene seems riddled with clich Ã and seems to demand it's own disaster sequence. The characters get insufficient time to win us over and the human interest ephemera like the hero's daughter 's bed wetting are grindingly forced. Worst of all the biggest Disaster Movie Clich Ã of all __ that the dog always survives, is alive and well.The climax of the film is grotesquely drawn out as man-made arks are launched to save civilisation. Incredibly this causes Emerich to then go into ""Poseidon Adventure"" mode, in an exercise of wholly unnecessary self indulgence. Inside all of this there is a decent film waiting to get out. The discipline, a word which Emerich does not know the meaning of, of delivering a 90 to 105 minute picture would have produced a much more satisfying, and impactful result.The end result is closest to 1950's style world disaster / Alien movies, but without the charm.

Use every possible clich Ã and stereotype from action movies from the last 30 years. Use every cent of the budget on CGI effects. Hire good actors who will do anything for a paycheck. And for the love of all that is Hollywood: do not come up with anything original.Seriously, this movie had every tired clich Ã in it and then some. The scenes are so unbelievable that the only people who will find this movie plausible are those that think that Star Wars was a documentary. An example being when Gordon is asked to fly a plane. He says, and I'm quoting here: ""I've only had a couple of lessons."" Now, the fact that once he gets airborne he makes Manfred on Richtofen look like someone who has never even so much as flown a kite is simply one of the hundreds of absurd things in this movie. But just when you think that there's no way they can top that joke then comes the two pilots flying the Antonov giant like it's an F-16. If this movie was marketed as a parody movie making fun of end of the world movies, it would have worked better.This movie is also a very clear character study. There's the good guy, the obvious bad guy and each character gets... well, pretty much what they've deserved and gotten in every action movie of the past 30 years. Woody Harrelson does his best Crispin Glover in this, which, again, works great as a comedy. There was zero imagination regarding the characters in this movie, it was so scarily predictable. Additionally, each scene tries to outdo the previous one and it just becomes a big, gigantic joke. I was laughing hysterically at all the ""tearjerker"" scenes of people about to die because they were so trite and had been done much better in movies before this one.

But just in case you haven't, there's now a multi-billion dollar film to show us exactly how it's going to happen.From the director of ""Independence Day"" and ""Day After Tomorrow,"" (two other horrid motion pictures) comes ""2012,"" easily one of the worst written and acted movies of the Apocalypse. In fact, this makes ""Fools Gold"" and ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" look lucid and intelligent by comparison.Basically, it's nothing but a clone of every big-budget disaster film - ""Day After,"" ""War of the Worlds"" (new version), ""The Knowing,"" ""Twister,"" ""Poseiden,"" ""Armageddon,"" ""Deep Impact,"" ""Dante's Peak,"" ""Earthquake,"" ""Evan Almighty,"" ""Speed"" and others all rolled into one with the decibel level cranked up to the power of 10.With the suddenly talentless John Cusack (what happened to such roles as ""High Fidelity"" and ""Eight Men Out""?) at the helm, this one goes into the crapper fast - just like the world as we know it. Cusack plays a failed author who now works as a chauffeur for a fat Russian slob with two obnoxious sons. His estranged wife, Amanda Peet, is dating a fairly decent plastic surgeon and his kids want nothing to do with him. On a camping trip to Yellowstone Park, he and the moppets run into a crazy guy broadcasting doom and gloom from his Winnebago (Woody Harrelson looking more like Nick Nolte's drunk driving photo than his lovable ""Cheers"" character).He also runs into a bubbling underground lake and is promptly escorted off the premises by the U.S. military. Needless to say, because the earth's core is heating to unsurvivable levels, the crust is becoming unstable and the world as we know it will collapse in a matter of days.Never mind that plate tectonics and continental shift are processes that would take thousands - if not millions - of years. In this movie, we get it right away, just like a fast food meal.Here's where the big-budget CGI effort goes into full effect. We see first California, then the rest of the nation systematically destroyed by various earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanoes as Cusack and his goofy family and friends escape time after time. Even Danny Glover as the President cannot save the day, although his Chief of Staff, played by Oliver Platt (whom we last saw getting oil rubbed on his paunchy stomach by Michael Cera in ""Year One""), does his best to save his own skin.Cusack and Co. then make it to China and discover the existence of several large ships designed to save what's left of Mankind and - oh why am I even bothering to explain ANYTHING about this loud, ridiculous mess that contains the worst dialogue imaginable, a laughable conclusion and plot-holes one could steer a small planet through?That, plus the fact this mishmash is almost THREE hours long. I saw it in 2009 and it FELT like it was 2012 before I got out of the theater.

I just want my money back. The movie is all eye-candy, and then you're done with the ""box"" after almost 3 hours. The movie should've been called by its full name: 2012 - A Bucketload of Coincidences.I'm not even going to provide context in a well-written manner for the horrible parts in the film, so here it goes: Let's start with John Cusack, who plays an author with marital problems, but he must have ESP or psychic abilities to foresee that everything about the near future is dire and in need of escape. He jumps fences which just happen to be controlled by military forces that know of his famous book. He just happens to have written about a mythological topic which seems to be unfolding before his eyes. And his physical abilities to take on these world disasters is amazing. Let's jump to the bad visual jokes, like the one when the couple are in the supermarket, saying ""Let's never split up"" and then a ""small"" earthquake literally divides the two hand-holders. It splits the Sistine Chapel in half, right in between where ""Adam"" touches ""God"" in the painting. Every escape is near-death and impossible to pull off in real life. Around the end John Cusack seems to possess gills or at least lungs like a fish for as long as he was underwater, as does his son. The music was forgettable and generic, even during the flash-bang explosions of fire and lava and other pyrotechnic crap they threw on the screen.Then come the questions: in the end, they get away alive on vessels set sail for...wherever. What do they use for fuel after everything's demolished. Or food? What does that giraffe meat taste like, and how soon before Cusack degrades into cannibalism? The ships took in a lot of water...why did they not sink? In fact I was more curious about their outcome after the credits started rolling than I was in the relationship between Cusack and the new step-dad, or any other part of the movie. So everything's destroyed...now what? Good luck.The best part of the movie was the hilariously-bad animation of Woody Harrelson's character explaining the 2012 concept on his computer...that's it. And that's all of the explanation you'll get about why 2012 was devised by Westerners to be a year of disaster.

That part of the film is a technical masterpiece (and it's what they showed in the trailer for good reason). The first half of this movie is watchable just because of the special effects. Once you get to the halfway point, the effects start to slip a little bit (I felt the ice and water effects weren't that good) and once the effects go, the film goes.The story and characters are all bland clich Ãs. You've got a several people trying to save their broken families and coming together or saving each other at the end, which has been done a billion times. You have the passionate scientist who cares about people against the dickish politician, which has been done a billion times. You have a bunch of landmarks getting destroyed, which looks cool, but it's been done a billion times. And you have arguments of humanity vs. survival which have been done a billion times, and much better than they're done here.When there are no special effects, there are one of two possible things going on. The first is broken families trying to survive (yawn). And the second is politicians arguing. Because when I think cataclysmic destruction of the world... my first thought is C-SPAN, and all the excitement of... watching senators, scientists, and yes-men getting annoyed with each other, making veiled threats, passionate speeches about what the other guy is doing wrong, and yelling about principles and matters of procedure which no one else really cares about.In all, I was really bored by this and the political BS just got on my nerves. It's really not an interesting movie. And I did start to nod off towards the end when it got REALLY stupid (they have the happy ending that defies all logic, just to have a happy ending).I could go into more detail, but I really just thought it was boring, especially after the half- way mark when the special effects started to look a little shabbier.3/10 - If you want to see some cool effects sequences, give it a look.

This movie was terrible. If you're going to make a movie about the end of the world, don't try and make it for families to go see. A movie like this should have blood, gore, trauma, real human emotion, painful sacrifice, love, loss, triumph, hope, and reflection of doing the right thing. You can tell that this movie attempted such things, but they went about it all wrong. All we get once again is action packed thrill ride scenes with absolutely no real and tangible emotion. I had the same problem with the new Indiana Jones. If there is no chemistry between your characters and the audience, then you have failed as a writer and as a movie maker. Thus this movie was an utter failure in my eyes. There is so much wrong with this movie, it isn't even funny. From the little things like knowing for a fact (being an ex-jet engine mechanic for the US Navy) that an engine would immediately stall if any amount of ash got inside and all your electronics would stop working if a volcano went off near you, to the big things like the directors attempt to make us care for all the evil billionaires who got to survive, but forget that the common man got screwed like usual. ***Spoiler Alert*** The ending of this movie was downright stupid. You expect me to believe the main characters got to the main land with a bunch of rich billionaire jerks and the people who let everyone die and live happily ever after. I don't think so, the writers of this movie obviously either thought about these things and didn't care, or were just a bunch of morons who didn't think about it. (I guess they could have just been lazy) This ending sums up the movie well with poorly thought out scenarios with a terrible story line masked by CGI effects all to make a crappy film for one reason only . . . to make money. I would love to remake this movie and rate it R, so I could capture what it would really be like if the world ended in 2012. So in short, if you're a mindless drone who doesn't care about cinema, plot development, or the character's on-screen chemistry; then go to this movie and enjoy, but if you are looking for more than overblown GGI effects and the mindless plot lines that we have come to expect from Hollywood these days, then by all means, go and see a good movie and scratch this one off your list.

Awesome special effects and awesome disregard for science, script, originality and simple common sense.My boyfriend and I must have looked like Al Jolson as we sat simultaneously open mouthed and rolling our eyes at the astonishing CGI and the laughable cod-science on offer, including mutating neutrinos, underfloor microwave heating (but no apparent increase in the air temperature!), dodgy political shorthand and grand larceny from every disaster movie from The Towering Inferno onwards.The effects are preposterously over the top and fantastic, with no road left uncracked, no plane able to fly higher than danger, no city too big to upend and slip into the sea like a punctured lilo. The destruction of LA is wanton and wonderful, with palm trees and piers disappearing before your very eyes, and the downtown area immeasurably improved by falling into a large hole.Then it's on to Vegas, and one can't help thinking there's something of the Sodom and Gomorrah in the glee of both cities' total annihilation.Similarly, the only moral of the story - if one can be found under the rubble - seems to be 'Plastic Surgery is Bad', as everyone involved in a particular boob job comes to an unpleasant end.John Cusack is a great actor and without his inclusion this movie would have been even more stupid, but he always manages to inject a bit of intelligence and humour, even into the Apocalypse. Good on yer John! There's an extraordinarily hackneyed 'plot' about a hopeless dad reconnecting with his kids during a disaster - a role already played once to good effect by Tom Cruise in War of the Worlds. Sadly it seems that nowadays - according to Hollywood - it takes Armageddon to make men grow up and take a bit of responsibility. The moral maze created in this particular instance (where the caring, loving, hardworking stepfather meets an unexpectedly unjust death merely to facilitate rekindled romance for Our Hero) is too tangled to be tackled in a mere review. Along with the patchwork science, it really needs a thesis to do it justice. Suffice to say, you've seen it all before, just not as big or as loud or as clich Ãd.The script has a few funny lines (mostly from Cusack) but they are overwhelmed by many hundreds more which were predictable, familiar, and downright dumb.The unintentionally hilarious moments include someone yelling about a job being 'a SUICIDE mission' - right before a ten year old boy manages to pull it off with a torch and a deep breath - and the brilliant geologist volunteering to fix a stuck gate on a trillion-dollar ship because, of course, scientific and mechanical knowledge is 100% interchangeable.Anyway, you get the picture.

The ending you're eventually left with is morally ambiguous for all involved and no amount of emotional rallying by the main actors is of any significance (it's easy to call for human kindness and empathy when you're one of the lucky few on the bridge of the main ark - even if you did leave your dad/family/friends behind to die).The memory of this will live on in the minds of those who don't appreciate it and tarnish the Director's name for a very long time (especially after his string of previous disasters).Was there any mileage whatsoever in the main family being dysfunctional?

The story is basically a rerun of the same director's (much more entertaining) ""The Day After Tomorrow"", with another disaster, general environmental disintegration, replacing the new ice age of that earlier effort.This might not matter too much if the story were well handled, peopled with engaging/plausible characters, or well acted, but it is none of those things. Instead, we have a number of cardboard cutouts going through the motions of interaction, using worldwide catastrophe as an opportunity to work out their personal issues by babbling the most jaded of clich Ãs.The most infuriating of these scenarios is between the trio of our ""hero"" Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), his estranged wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and her new man Gordon (Tom McCarthy). Jackson redeems himself in Kate's eyes with heroics of the kind towards which he has previously shown no inclination. Gordon is then conveniently killed off and, seemingly, completely forgotten within minutes. A pity really because at least McCarthy seemed to be making an effort. Cusack in particular barely seems to be awake much of the time and Peet is just plain dreadful.The only actor who emerges more or less unscathed from this mess is Woody Harrelson. His comic turn as a kind of apocalyptic shock jock, killed while watching the Yellowstone caldera erupt as a giant volcano, breathes some much needed life into the early scenes.I haven't mentioned the music, but it isn't really worth mentioning.

Jackson takes Noah and Lily on a camping trip to Yellowstone National Park, where they meet Charlie Frost, a conspiracy theorist living as a hermit and hosting a radio show from the park. Charlie references a theory that suggests the Mayans predicted the world would come to an end in 2012, and claims he has knowledge and a map of a secret ""space ship"" project. As evidence for his claims, he notes the suspicious deaths of many scientists who attempted to warn the public before information about the catastrophe was de-classified. The family returns home as cracks develop along the San Andreas Fault in California and earthquakes occur in many places along the west coast. Jackson grows suspicious and rents a plane to rescue his family. He collects his family and Gordon when the Earth's crust displacement begins and they escape Los Angeles as it slides into the Pacific Ocean. As the world collapses around them, they try to fly to China to board a ship meant only for the rich and VIP people of the world that will ensure their survival.While 2012 is entertaining on the special effects level, it's in no way realistic, so the story blew it on any level that I could have had respect for. For God's sake, my friend is in the navy and while we were watching this movie he mentioned how in Washington, DC, the USS Kennedy no longer exists and yet it does in this movie. Another thing, I love John Cussack, but is he the new Arnold Schwartzenegger? For God's sake, it seems like Ronald throws everything at him and yet something he manages to escape at last second for each disaster. My favorite is a tie: either they go to Yellow Stone to find their friend, but when the volcano erupts they drive away while meteors are being thrown at them and even hit's the RV they're driving and somehow it still manages to pull forward. Second being how they're able to fly an airplane over an erupting volcano as it would actually pull them down due to the air clogging the engine. Ronald also picks Danny Glover as president! LMAO! Are you serious?! I was just waiting for him to say ""I'm getting to old for this.."" when he finds out about the world ending. He and Thandie Newton seemed so out of place for the film.Please don't think that I hated this movie, I was just extremely disappointed, even if we want to be unrealistic on every level, it's OK. I just felt like this was a let down, like I said if Ronald wants to make this his last film, he should just go for it and make the world suffer. Unless he makes another film with him as a giant and just stepping on all the big cities, I'd buy a ticket on the spot. But I fell for it with 2012, it's totally worth it on the big screen just to see the special effects, but it's not going to have the same effect at home. The special effects were the only thing that made this film tolerable, but just a warning in advance, it's 2 and a _Ã¢ hours!

It was the ultimate disaster of a film. I expected to see something believable, something which could connect the Mayan prophecy to reality. Something plausible. But. I am still in shock. It takes a lot of courage for a producer to put in all that money in a no-script movie. But maybe because it is meant to do well at the box-office, keeping in mind the hype which surrounds it. But this is no-where close to art. No visual treat really. All that effort goes in vain. You don't want to watch the whole world die helplessly. There is nothing breathtaking about St. Peter's Cathedral's roof falling on praying priests, who believe in God. What's worse is, the movie used the tag line 'WE WERE WARNED'. Warned of?

You know there are these group of idiots, who have been selected to go on to the Ark leaving all of humanity behind to die. Including You. It's a terrible feeling trust me. I think the makers should be sued. The Mayan Prophecy and all the hype that surrounds it, makes it such a great plot for a movie.

The entire movie is a clich Ã of scenarios and attempted suspense and thrills that have been rehashed time and again in ""blockbuster"" movies. The main characters are of course able to survive through countless impossible close calls, it seems 3/4 of the time they are the only ones who miraculously (usually luckily) survive. The special effects scenes are the same thing over and over and over again, just with different things exploding or falling. Very monotonous, over long and boring.

I sometimes like conspiracy theory films, such as films like the X-Files.This film started out like Independence Day meets The Day After Tomorrow, films that are way better scripted than this. I felt as I watched this I was witnessing great actors such as John Cusack, Oliver Platt, and Danny Glover take a step down from how great they are. I really don't understand how and why they would take this role, I truly do not understand it.On a positive note the special effects were astounding, the only downside was that the effects were tied in with unbelievable writing. We watch Mr. Cusack hire a pilot to avoid the catastrophes, then when they arrive at the airport to take a plane to get away from it all, the pilot is dead or knocked unconscious. Now left to save Cusack's separated family is the new boyfriend of Cusack's now estranged wife to save the day. This man states that he had only a couple of flying lessons, but manages to fly around crashing skyscrapers and flaming balls of molten rock. Wow I wish I was that good! Finally, this film is a great ride if your into unbelievable situations preformed by normal everyday people. If you believe the world should of ended in 2012, then why am I still here in 2013? This was a great money grabber for Hollywood. It had great special effects with a bad script and excellent acting from the main stars. This recipe is destined for a disaster so to speak.The film is filled with American bravery from the President staying with the sinking ship of the United States of America(ya, right), to such laughable scenes of normal people going through the rat race of California streets collapsing around them. I think personally James Bond wouldn't even of survived this madness of a film.The score of the film was below par and done before, the shots of the film we have all seen before, the story seems way too familiar and beaten to death as we view this end of the world scenario. I will never watch this again, and will never recommend it to anyone. What a waste of actor talent and time. Disgusting. 2/10 for me, and the two stars go to the effects people and the actors. The writers should be fired from making any future motion pictures ever again.One last note: When trying to save humanity from the end of the world make sure your you don't drop your drill in the gears of the ocean vessel your trying to save. Because this one thing is the reason why everything could end, all because of one hand held power drill. What a joke! Tears are streaming from my eyes thinking about destroying Hollywood writers.

If some distant planet is in danger of exploding, we might just identify with the few humans that happen to be there while it's happening. But this is not a distant planet. This is Earth in just a few months time from now.The special effects in this movie are enough to make the viewer at least consider how awful it would be if this were really to happen. We see the planet fall apart before our eyes, and the realism is strikingly brilliant. The problem is, any concern we feel is for our own countries, our own people, our own families and loved ones. In my case, that's mainly western Europeans and South Americans. I feel for them as I see their homelands washed away under a sea of lava.But that is not what this movie wants.

Movie makers boldly go where no other movie makes have gone before... or do they? It is not a secret that apocalyptic movies draw crowds and that they sell because they cover ""what if"" questions that public raises but cant quite visualize. MOvie 2012 has a lot of potential with respect to material it can cover. In the end, however it delivered just like ""day after tomorrow"" did. Its a movie that when you are done watching it you quite literally say... ""yeah OK I guess it had an entertaining value to it but I will never watch it again"". Movie covered the obvious.. end of the world as we know it in 2012. They went into what could be classified as a preseason that established facts of early occurrence detections. It also went into talking about how rich are the only ones to go and of course it associated probable with some scientific observations. It is interesting that they chose to feature yellowstone but they did not give it enough place and time to sink in. It is interesting that they chose to use tsunamis that came in the end of the movie but again they almost did not make sense because significant portion of this earth (well inland portion) is located higher than even 1 mile high elevation. It would imply that even with tectonic shifts you would expect to see a lot more land available especially a month after tsunami hit. I like how they used earthquakes to kind of bring it all together but a few things were flawed with the movie... err take that back.. just about everything was flawed with the movie except the beginning. #1 choice of actors... OK fine but did they really need to make 90% of cast cheezy? #2 CGI. It was so bad that they made entire movie look like it was done on a home computer. Yes it was detailed and yes animators had some fun but we barely get to see any of it because director thought it was more appropriate to concentrate on filming cast faces 90% of the time. Most of the elements of what was happening were very unrealistic such as flying airplane while all kinds of debree is falling all around it but not on the plane itself. Then we have world's largest airplane maneuvre like its a cesna while flying over the city. #3 the arcs... really? In the alternative ending they were shown to be about 100 times bigger than a huge cruise ship which takes 3-5 years to build. Logistically speaking it would be impossible to build 1 such ship in 3-5 years.. let alone 10 ships or however many there were. More importantly if it was possible to build such ship then it would have to be next to where water, factories, mills, work force et cetera. Delivering bazillion tons of construction materials to top of tibet mountains is physically impossible in 3 years time. #4 the arcs. Umm.. why wern't they built to be submarines or submarine like? Would it not be easier to wait out tsunami and surface unscaved? #5 Transportation of animals to the compound. It is unbelievably cold at that altitude and no giraffes or elephants or any animal for that matter would survive the wind chill while dangling on a piece of rope. #6 aftermath. OK if crust has shifted.. what happened to spewing lava? I thought that because of crust shift land would be deformed since it is destablized. If land was deformed then water would get to where magma is and either evaporate or seep down and not randomly rise for eternity. #7 Satellites should have been knocked out. Supervolcanoes should have showered entire globe with ash and fallout. As such temperature would drop dramatically and water would ether be really really cold or frozen. This is one of the movies that tried to do too much too soon too fast.

Movies like Day After Tomorrow, Twister, the Core, and even some B-movies would at least have some sort of logic into the explanation as to what was causing the chaos, even if it is the typical blaming of global warming.However, I would be wrong to say that I didn't enjoy watching the movie; even if to satisfy the simple thrill of watching a super-disaster; just like riding a roller-coaster.

With every major government aware of the situation they make plans to safeguard humanity, getting all the world's treasures and getting rich people to donate __1 Billon for a ticket on ships to save people. Fast forward to 2012 and the world starts to crumble. Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is a struggling sci-fi writer and limo driver, who one holiday in Yellowstone National Park meets a conspiracy theorist (Woody Harrelson), who tells him about the ships to save humanity and before California falls into the sea Jackson saves his family, son Noah (Liam James), daughter Lily (Morgan Lily), ex-wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and plastic surgeon/Kate's boyfriend Gordon (Thomas McCarthy). In Washington D.C. there is a conflict between the president's scientific adviser Adrian Helmsmen (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) as they clash over what is the best way to save humanity whilst President Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover) has to deal with his conscience.Scientifically 2012 is complete rubbish and there are plot holes galore, from how could some massive ships be made in Tibet without anyone noticing? How could they build them in 2 years and have to make a base as well? Surely wouldn't scientists who were not involved with governments might have discovered what's going and wouldn't the media question the large number of deaths of prominent people. As well if this was sure a big crisis then governments would have made the ships be made by public money and wouldn't need to sell to the highest bidder. The plot about saving humanity and civilisation felt very much like Deep Impact but took a more unrealistic and unbelievable route. There is also the human element of disbelief from how Jackson seem to have the skills of a stunt driver and that Gordon would only had a few flying lessons is able to fly a plane through a collapsing city, which even a Stealth Fighter with top of the range computers would struggle to go through.As a director Emmerich is not known for his subtlety or his restraint. The death court in his disaster films has raisin from the world's major cities in Independence Day, the whole of the northern hemisphere in The Day After Tomorrow and know it is the whole world with 2012. The CGI effects are very good in 2012 and it is a fun, clean way to see millions of people getting killed: though I prefer it when a director only uses CGI when there is no other option and special effects do not make a film. There was a bit to much green screen and not enough scenes shot on location. But some of the scenes were just lifted from other films, like the plane taking of with the group collapsing is very much like the scene same in Independence Day, the ship being capsized is a cross between Poseidon and Titanic. The government preparations are a dumb downed version of Deep Impact and some of the family scenes are like a scene from a Spielberg film but very poorly done. Emmerich also follows his other popular theme of stupid or corrupt government officials who do not listen to reason. And the film is way too long and there are to many characters who are pointless or add nothing to the film: Thandie Newton may as well not been in it because her character did not do anything to the plot, there are stupid characters like the Russian twins and many other characters just serve to move the plot along. Plus it is too convenient about how some characters meet and know each other. Finally, a little SPOILOR ALERT: I really doubt that President's Chief-of-Staff would take the American government; wouldn't major politicians be saved so someone in the American command take over, from the Speaker, a Cabinet member or a senior senator. Plus I doubt the Italian PM would stay in Italy, particularly if he is meant to be like Silvio Belusconi who in real life would be the first to go and possibly take three of his finest prostitutes.Many of the actors know that 2012 is just rubbish and obviously did it for the money. They don't give their all. Ejiofor is a great actor and deserve to do more major roles and I think he needs to do a really good drama in the near future. Newton too is normally better then this and admittedly I though it was a little weird seeing two British actors together with American accents. Cusack obviously never followed his potential but he is not a good leading man in this film: he is more a comic actor then an action hero. I like Peet but her characters follows the clich Ã that she is still in love with her ex and Lily and Russian twins are some of the worst child actors I have seen for awhile. Glover is also an actor who was in the film because of the money and Harrelson who was offering comic relief has the mercy of limited screen time (his character was a little like the abducted crop-duster pilot in Independence Day). I like Harrelson normally. But character development has never been Emmerich's strong point.Overall this is a film that appeals to the lowest common denominated and relies on the audience have a no intelligent. There are some decent action sequences, but 2012 is pretty much a best of Emmerich which fails. Watch Independence Day or The Day After Tomorrow instead.

Firstly, it's strange to see a quirky actor like John Cusack in a fairly straight-faced action hero role. Secondly, despite the copious amounts of CGI on display, this is old school carnage, Emmerich having no time for the shaky cams and pseudo documentary stances of Spielberg's ""War Of The Worlds"", Bay's ""Transformer"" movies or fare like ""Cloverfield"" and ""The Mist"". Call it by-the-books ""end of the world classicism"" and you'd be right, but also a dick.The third interesting thing is the film's subtle spiritual and political vein. Emmerich adopts a strange anti-Christian, anti-Catholicism, anti-Western, pro-Eastern, pro-Buddhist, pro-African/""cradle-of-life"" tone, and jettisons his usual fondness for America's military and political prowess in favour for a world in which Western figureheads are all religious fanatics and selfish idiots and the Chinese are the new global superpower, fairly righteous, technologically advanced and with an economy robust enough to save the planet. Of course we shouldn't be surprised by this. Bad artists shift with the winds of change, great artists are so far ahead you don't see them making waves.The fourth interesting thing about the film is its sheer hypocrisy. This is a film which urges us to cherish human life but which treats life supremely cold-heartedly, Emmerich knocking off characters and killing millions, not only for our amusement, but without any emotional weight or visible moral concern. The way a Russian woman is killed in the final act, and then swiftly forgotten, is the kind of thing a better director would turn into satire, or use to make a critical point, but for Emmerich she's just another special effect to be used and discarded.The fifth interesting thing is the way the film continues Emmerich's fondness for naming films after dates. ""Independence Day"", ""2012, ""The Day After Tomorrow""...the guy's filmography is a calendar on steroids.The sixth interesting thing about the film is the way ""2012"" relentlessly taps into the noir universe. This is disaster movie meets Philip Marlowe (the hero is a writer __ pay attention to the books in the film), the film's predestined cataclysm mercilessly bearing down on mankind. Nature's the ultimate femme fatale, always hungry and always in heat.The seventh interesting thing is the sheer banality of the film's CGI. Modern lust's for spectacle can no longer be satisfied. It is not only that spectacle is dead - and soon the concept of the ""spectator"" itself - but that audiences are increasingly aware that spectacle can provide nothing. There's a blankness, a flatness, an emptiness, to today's spectacle. It is dead, soulless. But this soulnessness is not a new thing, but a shift in awareness, a realisation that today's spectacular fabric of 1s and 0s can quench nothing, nor can the solid state sfx of the past. Like an old man clinging to his youth by pathetically indulging in flashy sports cars, the exponentially bigger and glossier explosions of these films, everything from ""Avatar"" to ""2012"", cover up something truly pitiable. Emmerich destroys the world and no one bats an eyelid. Why should they? Able to plug into simulational, interactive console carnage, New Man's too wired to be fazed. But interactive communities don't bridge the gap, they slice it up and multiply it. There it is..now its gone__then it's back. Triangle. Square. Circle. Enter. Space. No Esc.7.5/10 __ If we don't compare it to Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"", in which calculated calamity is served with superiority, ""2012"" offers fairly good popcorn entertainment. Still, Emmerich's films tend to age badly. Will Smith helps ""Independence Day"" hold up today, but even that film's SFX now look strangely quaint.Worth two viewings.

2012,995,Andariel Halo (phenomynouss@hotmail.com),03/Nov/10,3,1.108731396176438e-07,movie not story good characters much just makes movies enough never only made without people something human doesnt character worth full far seen right,1.0,1.0,inf,inf,inf," This is no award-winning movie, with strengths in acting or story or the like. It's essentially the latest ""stuff blowing up"" movie by Roland Emmerich, who makes these movies regularly, for money.However, something about this movie makes it stand out particularly dreadfully from most others of the same genre. The introductory sequence of LA breaking apart is full of shots of people in cars as their cars are destroyed, people being killed as stuff knocks them around, and shots of huge skyscrapers crumbling and tumbling, and quick shots of people inside the wreckage, clinging to things helplessly.It's almost impossible for me to watch. It's too traumatizing, too sickening, and cannot be properly tempered by the fact that it's all just CGI fiction. The fact is, the shots of people bear a far too striking resemblance to the scenes from September 11th 2001, where we saw people jumping out of the towers to their inevitable deaths.But enough of that. On the brighter side, as I've noticed with ""10,000 BC"", Roland Emmerich is very good with broader story lines, and very bad with smaller story lines involving individual people. The concept of the Arks and everything after the initial ""stuff blowing up"" parts are decent enough, but the individual characters are one-dimensional archetypes you've seen in pretty much all his movies and others.Oliver Platt's character is the stereotypical ""bad guy"" because he's the voice of reason, taken to the extreme of cold logic and rationality at the expense of human lives---the Superego. He justifies the fact that the majority of those being saved in the Arks are the very rich, because without their money supporting it, the project would never have gotten started. There's Chiwetel Ejiofor's character, the opposite of him, the Id, who mopes constantly and contradicts the ""bad guy"" with emotion and humanity. There's the bumbling fat foreign guy and his trophy wife, whom he betrays and leaves for dead, only to be betrayed in turn by her later on. There's the dorky science guy, played in the exact same vein as Dr. Phlox from Star Trek Enterprise (obviously it's the same actor) by John Billingsley Amazingly (for a movie like this) there are inklings of contradictions in some characters---tendencies for them to act outside of their archetypes, but these are few and far between. Speaking of which, plenty of dialogue is stupid and clich Ã'd, like ""who would have thought the crazies with the cardboard signs would be right?"" and the scenes not involving the Arks or the ""stuff blowing up"" is largely boring and filler.Amazingly again, just a few superficial changes, particularly involving characterization, would have made this movie uniquely different from others of the same genre, and probably worth 3 or 4 stars out of 5.

A lot of people have bombed on it, and now I understand why.Setting aside the special effects (which were great, I admit,) we must turn to the special defects, primarily the ocean of trite, sentimental mush. Parents are separated, dad's distant because he's busy with his career, wifey has found a new guy, the kids are as distant to their birth dad as he is to his family (in order to force this point down our throats, the son routinely calls dad by his first name, just so we won't imagine they're close or anything.).Then things start to fall apart worldwide. There is a lovable radio-talk nutcase who is, of course, right about everything that's about to happen; the family (including dad 2, who possesses invaluable skills) are swept-up in these terrifying events, and by the end humanity is kind of sort of saved, dad 2 is nobly sacrificed to open the role of paterfamilias to the birth dad, and the family unit is back together, all huggy-wuggy and ready to embark on the bold new adventure ahead!Of course we have the obligatory ""what makes us human we can't leave all those people to die"" speech and a scientist involved in a secondary romance; we also get the seemingly heartless politician who, in my opinion, is really the voice of common sense.I hate this film, and I won't be watching it again. Once more, just to be clear: i'm glad as hell I didn't see this in the theater. As bad as the story is, I don't think even big-screen treatment would have helped.**** for the special effects.
